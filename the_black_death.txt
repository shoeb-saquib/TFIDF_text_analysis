                         GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.


That Omnipotence which has called the world with all its living
creatures into one animated being, especially reveals himself in
the desolation of great pestilences. The powers of creation come
into violent collision; the sultry dryness of the atmosphere; the
subterraneous thunders; the mist of overflowing waters, are the
harbingers of destruction. Nature is not satisfied with the ordinary
alternations of life and death, and the destroying angel waves over man
and beast his flaming sword.

These revolutions are performed in vast cycles, which the spirit of
man, limited, as it is, to a narrow circle of perception, is unable
to explore. They are, however, greater terrestrial events than any of
those which proceed from the discord, the distress, or the passions of
nations. By annihilations they awaken new life; and when the tumult
above and below the earth is past, nature is renovated, and the
mind awakens from torpor and depression to the consciousness of an
intellectual existence.

Were it in any degree within the power of human research to draw up,
in a vivid and connected form, an historical sketch of such mighty
events, after the manner of the historians of wars and battles, and the
migrations of nations, we might then arrive at clear views with respect
to the mental development of the human race, and the ways of Providence
would be more plainly discernible. It would then be demonstrable, that
the mind of nations is deeply affected by the destructive conflict of
the powers of nature, and that great disasters lead to striking changes
in general civilization. For all that exists in man, whether good or
evil, is rendered conspicuous by the presence of great danger. His
inmost feelings are roused—the thought of self-preservation masters
his spirit—self-denial is put to severe proof, and wherever darkness
and barbarism prevail, there the affrighted mortal flies to the idols
of his superstition, and all laws, human and divine, are criminally
violated.

In conformity with a general law of nature, such a state of excitement
brings about a change, beneficial or detrimental, according to
circumstances, so that nations either attain a higher degree of moral
worth, or sink deeper in ignorance and vice. All this, however, takes
place upon a much grander scale than through the ordinary vicissitudes
of war and peace, or the rise and fall of empires, because the powers
of nature themselves produce plagues, and subjugate the human will,
which, in the contentions of nations, alone predominates.





                             THE DISEASE.


The most memorable example of what has been advanced, is afforded
by a great pestilence of the fourteenth century, which desolated
Asia, Europe, and Africa, and of which the people yet preserve the
remembrance in gloomy traditions. It was an oriental plague, marked by
inflammatory boils and tumours of the glands, such as break out in no
other febrile disease. On account of these inflammatory boils, and from
the black spots, indicatory of a putrid decomposition, which appeared
upon the skin, it was called in Germany and in the northern kingdoms
of Europe, _the Black Death_, and in Italy, la Mortalega Grande, _the
Great Mortality_[4].

Few testimonies are presented to us respecting its symptoms and its
course, yet these are sufficient to throw light upon the form of the
malady, and they are worthy of credence, from their coincidence with
the signs of the same disease in modern times.

The imperial writer, Kantakusenos[5], whose own son, Andronikus, died
of this plague in Constantinople, notices great imposthumes[6] of
the thighs and arms of those affected, which, when opened, afforded
relief by the discharge of an offensive matter. Buboes, which are the
infallible signs of the oriental plague, are thus plainly indicated,
for he makes separate mention of smaller boils on the arms and in the
face, as also in other parts of the body, and clearly distinguishes
these from the blisters[7], which are no less produced by plague in all
its forms. In many cases, black spots[8] broke out all over the body,
either single, or united and confluent.

These symptoms were not all found in every case. In many, one alone was
sufficient to cause death, while some patients recovered, contrary to
expectation, though afflicted with all. Symptoms of cephalic affection
were frequent; many patients became stupified and fell into a deep
sleep, losing also their speech from palsy of the tongue; others
remained sleepless and without rest. The fauces and tongue were black,
and as if suffused with blood; no beverage would assuage their burning
thirst, so that their sufferings continued without alleviation until
terminated by death, which many in their despair accelerated with their
own hands. Contagion was evident, for attendants caught the disease of
their relations and friends, and many houses in the capital were bereft
even of their last inhabitant. Thus far the ordinary circumstances only
of the oriental plague occurred. Still deeper sufferings, however,
were connected with this pestilence, such as have not been felt at
other times; the organs of respiration were seized with a putrid
inflammation; a violent pain in the chest attacked the patient; blood
was expectorated, and the breath diffused a pestiferous odour.

In the West, the following were the predominating symptoms on the
eruption of this disease[9]. An ardent fever, accompanied by an
evacuation of blood, proved fatal in the first three days. It appears
that buboes and inflammatory boils did not at first come out at all,
but that the disease, in the form of carbuncular (_anthraxartigen_)
affection of the lungs, effected the destruction of life before the
other symptoms were developed.

Thus did the plague rage in Avignon for six or eight weeks, and the
pestilential breath of the sick, who expectorated blood, caused a
terrible contagion far and near; for even the vicinity of those who
had fallen ill of plague was certain death[10]; so that parents
abandoned their infected children, and all the ties of kindred were
dissolved. After this period, buboes in the axilla and in the groin,
and inflammatory boils all over the body, made their appearance; but it
was not until seven months afterwards that some patients recovered with
matured buboes, as in the ordinary milder form of plague.

Such is the report of the courageous Guy de Chauliac, who vindicated
the honour of medicine, by bidding defiance to danger; boldly and
constantly assisting the affected, and disdaining the excuse of
his colleagues, who held the Arabian notion, that medical aid was
unavailing, and that the contagion justified flight. He saw the plague
twice in Avignon, first in the year 1348, from January to August, and
then twelve years later, in the autumn, when it returned from Germany,
and for nine months spread general distress and terror. The first time
it raged chiefly among the poor, but in the year 1360, more among the
higher classes. It now also destroyed a great many children, whom it
had formerly spared, and but few women.

The like was seen in Egypt[11]. Here also inflammation of the lungs was
predominant, and destroyed quickly and infallibly, with burning heat
and expectoration of blood. Here too the breath of the sick spread a
deadly contagion, and human aid was as vain as it was destructive to
those who approached the infected.

Boccacio, who was an eye-witness of its incredible fatality in
Florence, the seat of the revival of science, gives a more lively
description of the attack of the disease than his non-medical
contemporaries[12].

It commenced here, not as in the East, with bleeding at the nose, a
sure sign of inevitable death; but there took place at the beginning,
both in men and women, tumours in the groin and in the axilla, varying
in circumference up to the size of an apple or an egg, and called
by the people, pest-boils (gavoccioli). Then there appeared similar
tumours indiscriminately over all parts of the body, and black or blue
spots came out on the arms or thighs, or on other parts, either single
and large, or small and thickly studded. These spots proved equally
fatal with the pest-boils, which had been from the first regarded as
a sure sign of death[13]. No power of medicine brought relief—almost
all died within the first three days, some sooner, some later, after
the appearance of these signs, and for the most part entirely without
fever[14] or other symptoms. The plague spread itself with the greater
fury, as it communicated from the sick to the healthy, like fire among
dry and oily fuel, and even contact with the clothes and other articles
which had been used by the infected, seemed to induce the disease. As
it advanced, not only men, but animals fell sick and shortly expired,
if they had touched things belonging to the diseased or dead. Thus
Boccacio himself saw two hogs on the rags of a person who had died of
plague, after staggering about for a short time, fall down dead, as
if they had taken poison. In other places multitudes of dogs, cats,
fowls and other animals, fell victims to the contagion[15]; and it is
to be presumed that other epizootes among animals likewise took place,
although the ignorant writers of the fourteenth century are silent on
this point.

In Germany there was a repetition in every respect of the same
phenomena. The infallible signs of the oriental bubo-plague with its
inevitable contagion were found there as everywhere else; but the
mortality was not nearly so great as in the other parts of Europe[16].
The accounts do not all make mention of the spitting of blood, the
diagnostic symptom of this fatal pestilence; we are not, however,
thence to conclude that there was any considerable mitigation or
modification of the disease, for we must not only take into account
the defectiveness of the chronicles, but that isolated testimonies are
often contradicted by many others. Thus, the chronicles of Strasburg,
which only take notice of boils and glandular swellings in the axillæ
and groins[17], are opposed by another account, according to which the
mortal spitting of blood was met with in Germany[18]; but this again is
rendered suspicious, as the narrator postpones the death of those who
were thus affected, to the sixth, and (even the) eighth day, whereas,
no other author sanctions so long a course of the disease; and even in
Strasburg, where a mitigation of the plague may, with most probability,
be assumed, since in the year 1349, only 16,000 people were carried
off, the generality expired by the third or fourth day[19]. In
Austria, and especially in Vienna, the plague was fully as malignant
as anywhere, so that the patients who had red spots and black boils,
as well as those afflicted with tumid glands, died about the third
day[20]; and lastly, very frequent sudden deaths occurred on the coasts
of the North Sea and in Westphalia, without any further development of
the malady[21].

To France, this plague came in a northern direction from Avignon, and
was there more destructive than in Germany, so that in many places not
more than two in twenty of the inhabitants survived. Many were struck,
as if by lightning, and died on the spot, and this more frequently
among the young and strong than the old; patients with enlarged glands
in the axillæ and groins scarcely survived two or three days: and no
sooner did these fatal signs appear, than they bid adieu to the world,
and sought consolation only in the absolution which Pope Clement VI.
promised them in the hour of death[22].

In England the malady appeared, as at Avignon, with spitting of blood,
and with the same fatality, so that the sick who were afflicted either
with this symptom or with vomiting of blood, died in some cases
immediately, in others within twelve hours, or at the latest, in two
days[23]. The inflammatory boils and buboes in the groins and axillæ
were recognised at once as prognosticating a fatal issue, and those
were past all hope of recovery in whom they arose in numbers all over
the body. It was not till towards the close of the plague that they
ventured to open, by incision, these hard and dry boils, when matter
flowed from them in small quantity, and thus, by compelling nature to
a critical suppuration, many patients were saved. Every spot which the
sick had touched, their breath, their clothes, spread the contagion;
and, as in all other places, the attendants and friends who were either
blind to their danger or heroically despised it, fell a sacrifice
to their sympathy. Even the eyes of the patient were considered as
sources of contagion[24], which had the power of acting at a distance,
whether on account of their unwonted lustre or the distortion which
they always suffer in plague, or whether in conformity with an ancient
notion, according to which the sight was considered as the bearer of a
demoniacal enchantment. Flight from infected cities seldom availed the
fearful, for the germ of the disease adhered to them, and they fell
sick, remote from assistance, in the solitude of their country houses.

Thus did the plague spread over England with unexampled rapidity,
after it had first broken out in the county of Dorset, whence it
advanced through the counties of Devon and Somerset, to Bristol, and
thence reached Gloucester, Oxford and London. Probably few places
escaped, perhaps not any; for the annals of contemporaries report that
throughout the land only a tenth part of the inhabitants remained
alive[25].

From England the contagion was carried by a ship to Bergen, the capital
of Norway, where the plague then broke out in its most frightful form,
with vomiting of blood; and throughout the whole country, spared not
more than a third of the inhabitants. The sailors found no refuge in
their ships; and vessels were often seen driving about on the ocean and
drifting on shore, whose crews had perished to the last man[26].

In Poland the infected were attacked with spitting of blood, and died
in a few days in such vast numbers, that, as it has been affirmed,
scarcely a fourth of the inhabitants were left[27].

Finally, in Russia the plague appeared two years later than in Southern
Europe; yet here again, with the same symptoms as elsewhere. Russian
contemporaries have recorded that it began with rigor, heat, and
darting pain in the shoulders and back; that it was accompanied by
spitting of blood, and terminated fatally in two, or at most, three
days. It is not till the year 1360, that we find buboes mentioned as
occurring in the neck, in the axillæ and in the groins, which are
stated to have broken out when the spitting of blood had continued some
time. According to the experience of Western Europe, however, it cannot
be assumed that these symptoms did not appear at an earlier period[28].

Thus much, from authentic sources, on the nature of the Black Death.
The descriptions which have been communicated contain, with a few
unimportant exceptions, all the symptoms of the oriental plague which
have been observed in more modern times. No doubt can obtain on this
point. The facts are placed clearly before our eyes. We must, however,
bear in mind that this violent disease does not always appear in the
same form, and that while the essence of the poison which it produces,
and which is separated so abundantly from the body of the patient,
remains unchanged, it is proteiform in its varieties, from the almost
imperceptible vesicle, unaccompanied by fever, which exists for some
time before it extends its poison inwardly, and then excites fever and
buboes, to the fatal form in which carbuncular inflammations fall upon
the most important viscera.

Such was the form which the plague assumed in the 14th century, for
the accompanying chest affection which appeared in all the countries
whereof we have received any account, cannot, on a comparison with
similar and familiar symptoms, be considered as any other than the
inflammation of the lungs of modern medicine[29], a disease which at
present only appears sporadically, and, owing to a putrid decomposition
of the fluids, is probably combined with hemorrhages from the vessels
of the lungs. Now, as every carbuncle, whether it be cutaneous or
internal, generates in abundance the matter of contagion which has
given rise to it, so, therefore, must the breath of the affected
have been poisonous in this plague, and on this account its power
of contagion wonderfully increased; wherefore the opinion appears
incontrovertible, that owing to the accumulated numbers of the
diseased, not only individual chambers and houses, but whole cities
were infected, which, moreover, in the middle ages, were, with few
exceptions, narrowly built, kept in a filthy state, and surrounded with
stagnant ditches[30]. Flight was, in consequence, of no avail to the
timid; for even though they had sedulously avoided all communication
with the diseased and the suspected, yet their clothes were saturated
with the pestiferous atmosphere, and every inspiration imparted to
them the seeds of the destructive malady, which, in the greater number
of cases, germinated with but too much fertility. Add to which, the
usual propagation of the plague through clothes, beds, and a thousand
other things to which the pestilential poison adheres,—a propagation,
which, from want of caution, must have been infinitely multiplied;
and since articles of this kind, removed from the access of air, not
only retain the matter of contagion for an indefinite period, but also
increase its activity and engender it like a living being, frightful
ill consequences followed for many years after the first fury of the
pestilence was past.

The affection of the stomach, often mentioned in vague terms, and
occasionally as a vomiting of blood, was doubtless only a subordinate
symptom, even if it be admitted that actual hematemesis did occur. For
the difficulty of distinguishing a flow of blood from the stomach, from
a pulmonic expectoration of that fluid, is, to non-medical men, even in
common cases, not inconsiderable. How much greater then must it have
been in so terrible a disease, where assistants could not venture to
approach the sick without exposing themselves to certain death? Only
two medical descriptions of the malady have reached us, the one by the
brave _Guy de Chauliac_, the other by _Raymond Chalin de Vinario_, a
very experienced scholar, who was well versed in the learning of his
time. The former takes notice only of fatal coughing of blood; the
latter, besides this, notices epistaxis, hematuria and fluxes of blood
from the bowels, as symptoms of such decided and speedy mortality, that
those patients in whom they were observed, usually died on the same or
the following day[31].

That a vomiting of blood may not, here and there, have taken
place, perhaps have been even prevalent in many places, is, from a
consideration of the nature of the disease, by no means to be denied;
for every putrid decomposition of the fluids begets a tendency to
hemorrhages of all kinds. Here, however, it is a question of historical
certainty, which, after these doubts, is by no means established. Had
not so speedy a death followed the expectoration of blood, we should
certainly have received more detailed intelligence respecting other
hemorrhages; but the malady had no time to extend its effects further
over the extremities of the vessels. After its first fury, however,
was spent, the pestilence passed into the usual febrile form of the
oriental plague. Internal carbuncular inflammations no longer took
place, and hemorrhages became phenomena, no more essential in this
than they are in any other febrile disorders. Chalin, who observed
not only the _great mortality_ of 1348, and the plague of 1360, but
also that of 1373 and 1382, speaks moreover of _affections of the
throat_, and describes the _black spots_ of plague patients more
satisfactorily than any of his contemporaries. The former appeared but
in few cases, and consisted in carbuncular inflammation of the gullet,
with a difficulty of swallowing, even to suffocation, to which, in
some instances, was added inflammation of the ceruminous glands of
the ears, with tumours, producing great deformity. Such patients, as
well as others, were affected with expectoration of blood; but they
did not usually die before the sixth, and sometimes, even so late as
the fourteenth day[32]. The same occurrence, it is well known, is not
uncommon in other pestilences; as also blisters on the surface of the
body, in different places, in the vicinity of which, tumid glands and
inflammatory boils, surrounded by discoloured and black streaks, arose,
and thus indicated the reception of the poison. These streaked spots
were called, by an apt comparison, _the girdle_, and this appearance
was justly considered extremely dangerous[33].





                            CAUSES.—SPREAD.


An inquiry into the causes of the Black Death, will not be without
important results in the study of the plagues which have visited
the world, although it cannot advance beyond generalization without
entering upon a field hitherto uncultivated, and, to this hour,
entirely unknown. Mighty revolutions in the organism of the earth, of
which we have credible information, had preceded it. From China to the
Atlantic, the foundations of the earth were shaken,—throughout Asia and
Europe the atmosphere was in commotion, and endangered, by its baneful
influence, both vegetable and animal life.

The series of these great events began in the year 1333, fifteen years
before the plague broke out in Europe: they first appeared in China.
Here a parching drought, accompanied by famine, commenced in the tract
of country watered by the rivers Kiang and Hoai. This was followed
by such violent torrents of rain, in and about Kingsai, at that time
the capital of the empire, that, according to tradition, more than
400,000 people perished in the floods. Finally the mountain Tsincheou
fell in, and vast clefts were formed in the earth. In the succeeding
year (1334), passing over fabulous traditions, the neighbourhood of
Canton was visited by inundations; whilst in Tche, after an unexampled
drought, a plague arose, which is said to have carried off about
5,000,000 of people. A few months afterwards an earthquake followed,
at and near Kingsai; and subsequent to the falling in of the mountains
of Ki-ming-chan, a lake was formed of more than a hundred leagues in
circumference, where, again, thousands found their grave. In Hou-kouang
and Ho-nan, a drought prevailed for five months; and innumerable swarms
of locusts destroyed the vegetation; while famine and pestilence, as
usual, followed in their train. Connected accounts of the condition
of Europe before this great catastrophe, are not to be expected from
the writers of the fourteenth century. It is remarkable, however,
that simultaneously with a drought and renewed floods in China, in
1336, many uncommon atmospheric phenomena, and in the winter, frequent
thunder storms, were observed in the north of France; and so early
as the eventful year of 1333, an eruption of Etna took place[34].
According to the Chinese annals, about 4,000,000 of people perished by
famine in the neighbourhood of Kiang in 1337: and deluges, swarms of
locusts, and an earthquake which lasted six days, caused incredible
devastation. In the same year, the first swarms of locusts appeared in
Franconia, which were succeeded in the following year by myriads of
these insects. In 1338, Kingsai was visited by an earthquake of ten
days’ duration; at the same time France suffered from a failure in the
harvest; and thenceforth, till the year 1342, there was in China, a
constant succession of inundations, earthquakes, and famines. In the
same year great floods occurred in the vicinity of the Rhine and in
France, which could not be attributed to rain alone; for, everywhere,
even on the tops of mountains, springs were seen to burst forth, and
dry tracts were laid under water in an inexplicable manner. In the
following year, the mountain Hong-tchang, in China, fell in, and caused
a destructive deluge; and in Pien-tcheou and Leang-tcheou, after three
months’ rain, there followed unheard-of inundations, which destroyed
seven cities. In Egypt and Syria, violent earthquakes took place; and
in China they became, from this time, more and more frequent; for
they recurred, in 1344, in Ven-tcheou, where the sea overflowed in
consequence; in 1345, in Ki-tcheou, and in both the following years
in Canton, with subterraneous thunder. Meanwhile, floods and famine
devastated various districts, until 1347, when the fury of the elements
subsided in China[35].

The signs of terrestrial commotions commenced in Europe in the year
1348, after the intervening districts of country in Asia had probably
been visited in the same manner.

On the island of Cyprus, the plague from the East had already broken
out; when an earthquake shook the foundations of the island, and was
accompanied by so frightful a hurricane, that the inhabitants who had
slain their Mahometan slaves, in order that they might not themselves
be subjugated by them, fled in dismay, in all directions. The sea
overflowed—the ships were dashed to pieces on the rocks, and few
outlived the terrific event, whereby this fertile and blooming island
was converted into a desert. Before the earthquake, a pestiferous wind
spread so poisonous an odour, that many, being overpowered by it, fell
down suddenly and expired in dreadful agonies[36].

This phenomenon is one of the rarest that has ever been observed, for
nothing is more constant than the composition of the air; and in no
respect has nature been more careful in the preservation of organic
life. Never have naturalists discovered in the atmosphere foreign
elements, which, evident to the senses, and borne by the winds, spread
from land to land, carrying disease over whole portions of the earth,
as is recounted to have taken place in the year 1348. It is, therefore,
the more to be regretted, that in this extraordinary period, which,
owing to the low condition of science, was very deficient in accurate
observers, so little that can be depended on respecting those uncommon
occurrences in the air, should have been recorded. Yet, German accounts
say expressly, that a thick, stinking mist advanced from the East, and
spread itself over Italy[37]; and there could be no deception in so
palpable a phenomenon[38]. The credibility of unadorned traditions,
however little they may satisfy physical research, can scarcely be
called in question when we consider the connexion of events; for just
at this time earthquakes were more general than they had been within
the range of history. In thousands of places chasms were formed, from
whence arose noxious vapours; and as at that time natural occurrences
were transformed into miracles, it was reported, that a fiery meteor,
which descended on the earth far in the East, had destroyed every
thing within a circumference of more than a hundred leagues, infecting
the air far and wide[39]. The consequences of innumerable floods
contributed to the same effect; vast river districts had been converted
into swamps; foul vapours arose everywhere, increased by the odour of
putrified locusts, which had never perhaps darkened the sun in thicker
swarms[40], and of countless corpses, which, even in the well regulated
countries of Europe, they knew not how to remove quickly enough out of
the sight of the living. It is probable, therefore, that the atmosphere
contained foreign, and sensibly perceptible, admixtures to a great
extent, which, at least in the lower regions, could not be decomposed,
or rendered ineffective by separation.

Now, if we go back to the symptoms of the disease, the ardent
inflammation of the lungs points out, that the organs of respiration
yielded to the attack of an atmospheric poison—a poison, which, if we
admit the independent origin of the Black Plague at any one place on
the globe, which, under such extraordinary circumstances, it would
be difficult to doubt, attacked the course of the circulation in as
hostile a manner as that which produces inflammation of the spleen, and
other animal contagions that cause swelling and inflammation of the
lymphatic glands.

Pursuing the course of these grand revolutions further, we find notice
of an unexampled earthquake, which, on the 25th of January, 1348, shook
Greece, Italy, and the neighbouring countries. Naples, Rome, Pisa,
Bologna, Padua, Venice and many other cities suffered considerably:
whole villages were swallowed up. Castles, houses and churches were
overthrown, and hundreds of people were buried beneath their ruins[41].
In Carinthia, thirty villages, together with all the churches, were
demolished; more than a thousand corpses were drawn out of the rubbish;
the city of Villach was so completely destroyed, that very few of
its inhabitants were saved; and when the earth ceased to tremble, it
was found that mountains had been moved from their positions, and
that many hamlets were left in ruins[42]. It is recorded that, during
this earthquake, the wine in the casks became turbid, a statement
which may be considered as furnishing a proof, that changes causing a
decomposition of the atmosphere had taken place; but if we had no other
information from which the excitement of conflicting powers of nature
during these commotions might be inferred, yet scientific observations
in modern times have shewn, that the relation of the atmosphere to the
earth is changed by volcanic influences. Why then, may we not, from
this fact, draw retrospective inferences respecting those extraordinary
phenomena?

Independently of this, however, we know that during this earthquake,
the duration of which is stated by some to have been a week, and by
others a fortnight, people experienced an unusual stupor and headache,
and that many fainted away[43].

These destructive earthquakes extended as far as the neighbourhood
of Basle[44], and recurred until the year 1360, throughout Germany,
France, Silesia, Poland, England and Denmark, and much further
north[45].

Great and extraordinary meteors appeared in many places, and were
regarded with superstitious horror. A pillar of fire, which on the 20th
of December, 1348, remained for an hour at sunrise over the pope’s
palace in Avignon[46]; a fireball, which in August of the same year
was seen at sunset over Paris, and was distinguished from similar
phenomena, by its longer duration[47], not to mention other instances
mixed up with wonderful prophecies and omens, are recorded in the
chronicles of that age.

The order of the seasons seemed to be inverted,—rains, floods and
failures in crops were so general, that few places were exempt from
them; and though an historian of this century assures us, that there
was an abundance in the granaries and storehouses[48], all his
contemporaries, with one voice, contradict him. The consequences of
failure in the crops were soon felt, especially in Italy and the
surrounding countries, where, in this year, a rain which continued for
four months, had destroyed the seed. In the larger cities, they were
compelled, in the spring of 1347, to have recourse to a distribution
of bread among the poor, particularly at Florence, where they erected
large bake-houses, from which, in April, ninety-four thousand loaves of
bread, each of twelve ounces in weight, were daily dispensed[49]. It is
plain, however, that humanity could only partially mitigate the general
distress, not altogether obviate it.

Diseases, the invariable consequence of famine, broke out in the
country, as well as in cities; children died of hunger in their
mothers’ arms,—want, misery and despair, were general throughout
Christendom[50].

Such are the events which took place before the eruption of the
Black Plague in Europe. Contemporaries have explained them after
their own manner, and have thus, like their posterity, under similar
circumstances, given a proof, that mortals possess neither senses nor
intellectual powers sufficiently acute to comprehend the phenomena
produced by the earth’s organism, much less scientifically to
understand their effects. Superstition, selfishness in a thousand
forms, the presumption of the schools, laid hold of unconnected facts.
They vainly thought to comprehend the whole in the individual, and
perceived not the universal spirit which, in intimate union with the
mighty powers of nature, animates the movements of all existence,
and permits not any phenomenon to originate from isolated causes. To
attempt, five centuries after that age of desolation, to point out the
causes of a cosmical commotion, which has never recurred to an equal
extent,—to indicate scientifically the influences which called forth so
terrific a poison in the bodies of men and animals, exceeds the limits
of human understanding. If we are even now unable, with all the varied
resources of an extended knowledge of nature, to define that condition
of the atmosphere by which pestilences are generated, still less can we
pretend to reason retrospectively from the nineteenth to the fourteenth
century; but if we take a general view of the occurrences, that century
will give us copious information, and, as applicable to all succeeding
times, of high importance.

In the progress of connected natural phenomena, from East to West,
that great law of nature is plainly revealed which has so often and
evidently manifested itself in the earth’s organism, as well as in
the state of nations dependent upon it. In the inmost depths of the
globe, that impulse was given in the year 1333, which in uninterrupted
succession for six-and-twenty years shook the surface of the earth,
even to the western shores of Europe. From the very beginning the
air partook of the terrestrial concussion, atmospherical waters
overflowed the land, or its plants and animals perished under the
scorching heat. The insect tribe was wonderfully called into life, as
if animated beings were destined to complete the destruction which
astral and telluric powers had begun. Thus did this dreadful work of
nature advance from year to year; it was a progressive infection of the
Zones, which exerted a powerful influence both above and beneath the
surface of the earth; and after having been perceptible in slighter
indications, at the commencement of the terrestrial commotions in
China, convulsed the whole earth.

The nature of the first plague in China is unknown. We have no certain
intelligence of the disease, until it entered the western countries of
Asia. Here it shewed itself as the oriental plague with inflammation
of the lungs; in which form it probably also may have begun in China,
that is to say, as a malady which spreads, more than any other,
by contagion—a contagion, that, in ordinary pestilences, requires
immediate contact, and only under unfavourable circumstances of rare
occurrence is communicated by the mere approach to the sick. The share
which this cause had in the spreading of the plague over the whole
earth, was certainly very great: and the opinion that the Black Death
might have been excluded from Western Europe, by good regulations,
similar to those which are now in use, would have all the support of
modern experience, provided it could be proved that this plague had
been actually imported from the East; or that the oriental plague in
general, whenever it appears in Europe, has its origin in Asia or
Egypt. Such a proof, however, can by no means be produced so as to
enforce conviction; for it would involve the impossible assumption,
either that there is no essential difference between the degree of
civilization of the European nations, in the most ancient and in modern
times, or that detrimental circumstances, which have yielded only to
the civilization of human society and the regular cultivation of
countries, could not formerly keep up the glandular plague.

The plague was, however, known in Europe before nations were united
by the bonds of commerce and social intercourse[51]; hence there is
ground for supposing that it sprung up spontaneously, in consequence
of the rude manner of living and the uncultivated state of the earth;
influences which peculiarly favour the origin of severe diseases. Now,
we need not go back to the earlier centuries, for the 14th itself,
before it had half expired, was visited by five or six pestilences[52].

If, therefore, we consider the peculiar property of the plague, that,
in countries which it has once visited, it remains for a long time
in a milder form, and that the epidemic influences of 1342, when it
had appeared for the last time, were particularly favourable to its
unperceived continuance, till 1348, we come to the notion, that in
this eventful year also, the germs of plague existed in Southern
Europe, which might be vivified by atmospherical deteriorations; and
that thus, at least in part, the Black Plague may have originated in
Europe itself. The corruption of the atmosphere came from the East; but
the disease itself came not upon the wings of the wind, but was only
excited and increased by the atmosphere where it had previously existed.

This source of the Black Plague was not, however, the only one; for,
far more powerful than the excitement of the latent elements of the
plague by atmospheric influences, was the effect of the contagion
communicated from one people to another, on the great roads, and
in the harbours of the Mediterranean. From China, the route of the
caravans lay to the north of the Caspian Sea, through Central Asia,
to Tauris. Here ships were ready to take the produce of the East to
Constantinople, the capital of commerce, and the medium of connexion
between Asia, Europe and Africa[53]. Other caravans went from India
to Asia Minor, and touched at the cities south of the Caspian Sea,
and lastly from Bagdad, through Arabia to Egypt; also the maritime
communication on the Red Sea, from India to Arabia and Egypt, was
not inconsiderable. In all these directions contagion made its way;
and doubtless, Constantinople and the harbours of Asia Minor, are to
be regarded as the foci of infection; whence it radiated to the most
distant seaports and islands.

To Constantinople, the plague had been brought from the northern coast
of the Black Sea[54], after it had depopulated the countries between
those routes of commerce; and appeared as early as 1347, in Cyprus,
Sicily, Marseilles and some of the seaports of Italy. The remaining
islands of the Mediterranean, particularly Sardinia, Corsica and
Majorca, were visited in succession. Foci of contagion existed also
in full activity along the whole southern coast of Europe; when, in
January 1348, the plague appeared in Avignon[55], and in other cities
in the south of France and north of Italy, as well as in Spain.

The precise days of its eruption in the individual towns, are no longer
to be ascertained; but it was not simultaneous; for in Florence, the
disease appeared in the beginning of April[56]; in Cesena, the 1st
of June[57]; and place after place was attacked throughout the whole
year; so that the plague, after it had passed through the whole of
France and Germany, where, however, it did not make its ravages until
the following year, did not break out till August, in England; where
it advanced so gradually, that a period of three months elapsed before
it reached London[58]. The northern kingdoms were attacked by it in
1349. Sweden, indeed, not until November of that year: almost two years
after its eruption in Avignon[59]. Poland received the plague in 1349,
probably from Germany[60], if not from the northern countries; but in
Russia, it did not make its appearance until 1351, more than three
years after it had broken out in Constantinople. Instead of advancing
in a north-westerly direction from Tauris and from the Caspian Sea,
it had thus made the great circuit of the Black Sea, by way of
Constantinople, Southern and Central Europe, England, the northern
kingdoms and Poland, before it reached the Russian territories; a
phenomenon which has not again occurred with respect to more recent
pestilences originating in Asia.

Whether any difference existed between the indigenous plague, excited
by the influence of the atmosphere, and that which was imported
by contagion, can no longer be ascertained from facts; for the
contemporaries, who in general were not competent to make accurate
researches of this kind, have left no data on the subject. A milder
and a more malignant form certainly existed, and the former was
not always derived from the latter, as is to be supposed from this
circumstance—that the spitting of blood, the infallible diagnostic of
the latter, on the first breaking out of the plague, is not similarly
mentioned in all the reports; and it is therefore probable, that the
milder form belonged to the native plague,—the more malignant, to that
introduced by contagion. Contagion was, however, in itself, only one of
many causes which gave rise to the Black Plague.

This disease was a consequence of violent commotions in the earth’s
organism—if any disease of cosmical origin can be so considered. One
spring set a thousand others in motion for the annihilation of living
beings, transient or permanent, of mediate or immediate effect. The
most powerful of all was contagion; for in the most distant countries
which had scarcely yet heard the echo of the first concussion, the
people fell a sacrifice to organic poison,—the untimely offspring of
vital energies thrown into violent commotion.





                              MORTALITY.


We have no certain measure by which to estimate the ravages of the
Black Plague, if numerical statements were wanted, as in modern times.
Let us go back for a moment to the 14th century. The people were yet
but little civilized. The church had indeed subdued them; but they
all suffered from the ill consequences of their original rudeness. The
dominion of the law was not yet confirmed. Sovereigns had everywhere
to combat powerful enemies to internal tranquillity and security.
The cities were fortresses for their own defence. Marauders encamped
on the roads.—The husbandman was a feodal slave, without possessions
of his own.—Rudeness was general.—Humanity, as yet unknown to the
people.—Witches and heretics were burned alive.—Gentle rulers were
contemned as weak;—wild passions, severity and cruelty, everywhere
predominated.—Human life was little regarded.—Governments concerned
not themselves about the numbers of their subjects, for whose welfare
it was incumbent on them to provide. Thus, the first requisite for
estimating the loss of human life, namely, a knowledge of the amount of
the population, is altogether wanting; and, moreover, the traditional
statements of the amount of this loss, are so vague, that from this
source likewise, there is only room for probable conjecture.

Kairo lost daily, when the plague was raging with its greatest
violence, from 10 to 15,000; being as many as, in modern times,
great plagues have carried off during their whole course. In China,
more than thirteen millions are said to have died; and this is in
correspondence with the certainly exaggerated accounts from the rest of
Asia. India was depopulated. Tartary, the Tartar kingdom of Kaptschak,
Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia, were covered with dead bodies—the Kurds
fled in vain to the mountains. In Caramania and Cæsarea, none were
left alive. On the roads,—in the camps,—in the caravansaries,—unburied
bodies alone were seen; and a few cities only (Arabian historians name
Maara el nooman, Schisur and Harem) remained, in an unaccountable
manner, free. In Aleppo, 500 died daily; 22,000 people, and most of
the animals, were carried off in Gaza, within six weeks. Cyprus lost
almost all its inhabitants[61]; and ships without crews were often
seen in the Mediterranean; as afterwards in the North Sea, driving
about, and spreading the plague wherever they went on shore[62]. It
was reported to Pope Clement, at Avignon, that throughout the East,
probably with the exception of China, 23,840,000 people had fallen
victims to the plague[63]. Considering the occurrences of the 14th
and 15th centuries, we might, on first view, suspect the accuracy of
this statement. How (it might be asked) could such great wars have been
carried on—such powerful efforts have been made; how could the Greek
empire, only a hundred years later, have been overthrown, if the people
really had been so utterly destroyed?

This account is nevertheless rendered credible by the ascertained fact,
that the palaces of princes are less accessible to contagious diseases
than the dwellings of the multitude; and that in places of importance,
the influx from those districts which have suffered least, soon repairs
even the heaviest losses. We must remember, also, that we do not gather
much from mere numbers without an intimate knowledge of the state of
society. We will, therefore, confine ourselves to exhibiting some of
the more credible accounts relative to European cities.

  In Florence there died of the Black Plague     60,000[64]
  In Venice                                     100,000[65]
  In Marseilles, in one month                    16,000[66]
  In Siena                                       70,000[67]
  In Paris                                       50,000[68]
  In St. Denys                                   14,000[69]
  In Avignon                                     60,000[70]
  In Strasburg                                   16,000[71]
  In Lübeck                                       9,000[72]
  In Basle                                       14,000
  In Erfurt, at least                            16,000
  In Weimar                                       5,000[73]
  In Limburg                                      2,500[74]
  In London, at least                           100,000[75]
  In Norwich                                     51,100[76]
    To which may be added—
  Franciscan Friars in Germany                  124,434[77]
  Minorites in Italy                             30,000[78]

This short catalogue might, by a laborious and uncertain calculation,
deduced from other sources, be easily further multiplied, but would
still fail to give a true picture of the depopulation which took
place. Lübeck, at that time the Venice of the North, which could no
longer contain the multitudes that flocked to it, was thrown into
such consternation on the eruption of the plague, that the citizens
destroyed themselves as if in frenzy.

Merchants whose earnings and possessions were unbounded, coldly and
willingly renounced their earthly goods. They carried their treasures
to monasteries and churches, and laid them at the foot of the altar;
but gold had no charms for the monks, for it brought them death. They
shut their gates; yet, still it was cast to them over the convent
walls. People would brook no impediment to the last pious work to which
they were driven by despair. When the plague ceased, men thought they
were still wandering among the dead, so appalling was the livid aspect
of the survivors, in consequence of the anxiety they had undergone,
and the unavoidable infection of the air[79]. Many other cities
probably presented a similar appearance; and it is ascertained that
a great number of small country towns and villages which have been
estimated, and not too highly, at 200,000[80], were bereft of all their
inhabitants.

In many places in France not more than two out of twenty of the
inhabitants were left alive[81], and the capital felt the fury of the
plague, alike in the palace and the cot.

Two queens[82], one bishop[83], and great numbers of other
distinguished persons, fell a sacrifice to it, and more than 500 a
day died in the Hôtel-Dieu, under the faithful care of the sisters of
charity, whose disinterested courage, in this age of horror, displayed
the most beautiful traits of human virtue. For although they lost their
lives, evidently from contagion, and their numbers were several times
renewed, there was still no want of fresh candidates, who, strangers to
the unchristian fear of death, piously devoted themselves to their holy
calling.

The churchyards were soon unable to contain the dead[84], and many
houses, left without inhabitants, fell to ruins.

In Avignon, the pope found it necessary to consecrate the Rhone, that
bodies might be thrown into the river without delay, as the churchyards
would no longer hold them[85]; so likewise, in all populous cities,
extraordinary measures were adopted, in order speedily to dispose
of the dead. In Vienna, where for some time 1200 inhabitants died
daily[86], the interment of corpses in the churchyards and within the
churches, was forthwith prohibited; and the dead were then arranged in
layers, by thousands, in six large pits outside the city[87], as had
already been done in Cairo, and Paris. Yet, still many were secretly
buried; for at all times, the people are attached to the consecrated
cemeteries of their dead, and will not renounce the customary mode of
interment.

In many places, it was rumoured that plague patients were buried
alive[88], as may sometimes happen through senseless alarm and indecent
haste; and thus the horror of the distressed people was everywhere
increased. In Erfurt, after the churchyards were filled, 12,000 corpses
were thrown into eleven great pits; and the like might, more or less
exactly, be stated with respect to all the larger cities[89]. Funeral
ceremonies, the last consolation of the survivors, were everywhere
impracticable.

In all Germany, according to a probable calculation, there seem to have
died only 1,244,434[90] inhabitants; this country, however, was more
spared than others: Italy, on the contrary, was most severely visited.
It is said to have lost half its inhabitants[91]; and this account is
rendered credible from the immense losses of individual cities and
provinces: for in Sardinia and Corsica, according to the account of the
distinguished Florentine, John Villani, who was himself carried off by
the Black Plague[92], scarcely a third part of the population remained
alive; and it is related of the Venetians, that they engaged ships at
a high rate to retreat to the islands; so that after the plague had
carried off three fourths of her inhabitants, that proud city was left
forlorn and desolate[93]. In Padua, after the cessation of the plague,
two thirds of the inhabitants were wanting; and in Florence it was
prohibited to publish the numbers of the dead, and to toll the bells at
their funerals, in order that the living might not abandon themselves
to despair[94].

We have more exact accounts of England; most of the great cities
suffered incredible losses; above all, Yarmouth, in which, 7052 died:
Bristol, Oxford, Norwich, Leicester, York and London where, in one
burial ground alone, there were interred upwards of 50,000 corpses,
arranged in layers, in large pits[95]. It is said, that in the whole
country, scarcely a tenth part remained alive[96]; but this estimate
is evidently too high. Smaller losses were sufficient to cause those
convulsions, whose consequences were felt for some centuries, in a
false impulse given to civil life, and whose indirect influence,
unknown to the English, has, perhaps, extended even to modern times.

Morals were deteriorated everywhere, and the service of God was, in
a great measure, laid aside; for, in many places, the churches were
deserted, being bereft of their priests. The instruction of the people
was impeded[97]; covetousness became general; and when tranquillity
was restored, the great increase of lawyers was astonishing, to whom
the endless disputes regarding inheritances, offered a rich harvest.
The want of priests too, throughout the country, operated very
detrimentally upon the people, (the lower classes being most exposed
to the ravages of the plague, whilst the houses of the nobility
were, in proportion, much more spared,) and it was no compensation
that whole bands of ignorant laymen, who had lost their wives during
the pestilence, crowded into the monastic orders, that they might
participate in the respectability of the priesthood, and in the rich
heritages which fell in to the church from all quarters. The sittings
of Parliament, of the King’s Bench, and of most of the other courts,
were suspended as long as the malady raged. The laws of peace availed
not during the dominion of death. Pope Clement took advantage of this
state of disorder, to adjust the bloody quarrel between Edward III.
and Philip VI.; yet he only succeeded during the period that the
plague commanded peace. Philip’s death (1350) annulled all treaties;
and it is related, that Edward, with other troops indeed, but with
the same leaders and knights, again took the field. Ireland was much
less heavily visited than England. The disease seems to have scarcely
reached the mountainous districts of that kingdom; and Scotland
too would, perhaps, have remained free, had not the Scots availed
themselves of the discomfiture of the English, to make an irruption
into their territory, which terminated in the destruction of their
army, by the plague and by the sword, and the extension of the
pestilence, through those who escaped, over the whole country.

At the commencement, there was in England a superabundance of all the
necessaries of life; but the plague, which seemed then to be the sole
disease, was soon accompanied by a fatal murrain among the cattle.
Wandering about without herdsmen, they fell by thousands; and, as
has likewise been observed in Africa, the birds and beasts of prey
are said not to have touched them. Of what nature this murrain may
have been, can no more be determined, than whether it originated from
communication with plague patients, or from other causes; but thus much
is certain, that it did not break out until after the commencement of
the Black Death. In consequence of this murrain, and the impossibility
of removing the corn from the fields, there was everywhere a great
rise in the price of food which to many was inexplicable, because the
harvest had been plentiful; by others it was attributed to the wicked
designs of the labourers and dealers; but it really had its foundation
in the actual deficiency arising from circumstances by which individual
classes at all times endeavour to profit. For a whole year, until
it terminated in August, 1349, the Black Plague prevailed in this
beautiful island, and everywhere poisoned the springs of comfort and
prosperity[98].

In other countries, it generally lasted only half a year, but returned
frequently in individual places; on which account, some, without
sufficient proof, assigned to it a period of seven years[99].

Spain was uninterruptedly ravaged by the Black Plague till after the
year 1350, to which the frequent internal feuds and the wars with the
Moors not a little contributed. Alphonso XI., whose passion for war
carried him too far, died of it at the siege of Gibraltar, on the 26th
of March, 1350. He was the only king in Europe who fell a sacrifice to
it; but even before this period, innumerable families had been thrown
into affliction[100]. The mortality seems otherwise to have been
smaller in Spain than in Italy, and about as considerable as in France.

The whole period during which the Black Plague raged with destructive
violence in Europe, was, with the exception of Russia, from the year
1347 to 1350. The plagues, which in the sequel often returned until
the year 1383[101], we do not consider as belonging to “the Great
Mortality.” They were rather common pestilences, without inflammation
of the lungs, such as in former times, and in the following centuries,
were excited by the matter of contagion everywhere existing, and which,
on every favourable occasion, gained ground anew, as is usually the
case with this frightful disease.

The concourse of large bodies of people was especially dangerous; and
thus, the premature celebration of the Jubilee, to which Clement VI.
cited the faithful to Rome, (1350,) during the great epidemic, caused a
new eruption of the plague, from which it is said, that scarcely one in
an hundred of the pilgrims escaped[102].

Italy was, in consequence, depopulated anew; and those who returned,
spread poison and corruption of morals in all directions[103]. It is,
therefore, the less apparent, how that Pope, who was in general so wise
and considerate, and who knew how to pursue the path of reason and
humanity, under the most difficult circumstances, should have been led
to adopt a measure so injurious; since he, himself, was so convinced of
the salutary effect of seclusion, that during the plague in Avignon, he
kept up constant fires, and suffered no one to approach him[104]; and,
in other respects, gave such orders as averted, or alleviated, much
misery.

The changes which occurred about this period in the north of Europe,
are sufficiently memorable to claim a few moments’ attention. In Sweden
two princes died—Håken and Knut, half-brothers of King Magnus; and in
Westgothland alone, 466 priests[105]. The inhabitants of Iceland and
Greenland, found in the coldness of their inhospitable climate, no
protection against the southern enemy who had penetrated to them from
happier countries. The plague caused great havoc among them. Nature
made no allowance for their constant warfare with the elements, and
the parsimony with which she had meted out to them the enjoyments of
life[106]. In Denmark and Norway, however, people were so occupied
with their own misery, that the accustomed voyages to Greenland
ceased. Towering icebergs formed at the same time on the coast of East
Greenland, in consequence of the general concussion of the earth’s
organism; and no mortal, from that time forward, has ever seen that
shore or its inhabitants[107].

It has been observed above, that in Russia, the Black Plague did
not break out until 1351, after it had already passed through the
south and north of Europe. In this country also, the mortality was
extraordinarily great; and the same scenes of affliction and despair
were exhibited, as had occurred in those nations which had already
passed the ordeal. The same mode of burial—the same horrible certainty
of death—the same torpor and depression of spirits. The wealthy
abandoned their treasures, and gave their villages and estates to
the churches and monasteries; this being, according to the notions
of the age, the surest way of securing the favour of Heaven and the
forgiveness of past sins. In Russia too, the voice of nature was
silenced by fear and horror. In the hour of danger, fathers and mothers
deserted their children, and children their parents[108].

Of all the estimates of the number of lives lost in Europe, the most
probable is, that altogether, a fourth part of the inhabitants were
carried off. Now, if Europe at present contain 210,000,000 inhabitants,
the population, not to take a higher estimate, which might easily be
justified, amounted to at least 105,000,000 in the 16th century.

It may, therefore, be assumed, without exaggeration, that Europe lost
during the Black Death, 25,000,000 of inhabitants.

That her nations could so quickly overcome such a fearful concussion
in their external circumstances, and, in general, without retrograding
more than they actually did, could so develope their energies in the
following century, is a most convincing proof of the indestructibility
of human society as a whole. To assume, however, that it did not
suffer any essential change internally, because in appearance every
thing remained as before, is inconsistent with a just view of cause
and effect. Many historians seem to have adopted such an opinion;
accustomed, as usual, to judge of the moral condition of the people
solely according to the vicissitudes of earthly power, the events
of battles, and the influence of religion, but to pass over with
indifference, the great phenomena of nature, which modify, not only the
surface of the earth, but also the human mind. Hence, most of them have
touched but superficially on the “great mortality” of the 14th century.
We, for our parts, are convinced, that in the history of the world, the
Black Death is one of the most important events which have prepared the
way for the present state of Europe.

He who studies the human mind with attention, and forms a deliberate
judgment on the intellectual powers which set people and states in
motion, may, perhaps, find some proofs of this assertion in the
following observations:—at that time, the advancement of the hierarchy
was, in most countries, extraordinary; for the church acquired
treasures and large properties in land, even to a greater extent than
after the crusades; but experience has demonstrated, that such a state
of things is ruinous to the people, and causes them to retrograde, as
was evinced on this occasion.

After the cessation of the Black Plague, a greater fecundity in
women was everywhere remarkable—a grand phenomenon, which, from its
occurrence after every destructive pestilence, proves to conviction,
if any occurrence can do so, the prevalence of a higher power in the
direction of general organic life. Marriages were, almost without
exception, prolific; and double and treble births were more frequent
than at other times; under which head, we should remember the strange
remark, that after the “great mortality” the children were said to have
got fewer teeth than before; at which contemporaries were mightily
shocked, and even later writers have felt surprise.

If we examine the grounds of this oft-repeated assertion, we shall
find that they were astonished to see children cut twenty, or at most,
twenty-two teeth, under the supposition that a greater number had
formerly fallen to their share[109]. Some writers of authority, as,
for example, the physician Savonarola[110], at Ferrara, who probably
looked for twenty-eight teeth in children, published their opinions on
this subject. Others copied from them, without seeing for themselves,
as often happens in other matters which are equally evident; and thus
the world believed in the miracle of an imperfection in the human body
which had been caused by the Black Plague.

The people gradually consoled themselves after the sufferings which
they had undergone; the dead were lamented and forgotten; and in
the stirring vicissitudes of existence, the world belonged to the
living[111].





                            MORAL EFFECTS.


The mental shock sustained by all nations during the prevalence of the
Black Plague, is without parallel and beyond description. In the eyes
of the timorous, danger was the certain harbinger of death; many fell
victims to fear, on the first appearance of the distemper[112], and
the most stout-hearted lost their confidence. Thus, after reliance on
the future had died away, the spiritual union which binds man to his
family and his fellow creatures, was gradually dissolved. The pious
closed their accounts with the world,—eternity presented itself to
their view,—their only remaining desire, was for a participation in
the consolations of religion, because to them death was disarmed of
its sting.

Repentance seized the transgressor, admonishing him to consecrate his
remaining hours to the exercise of Christian virtues. All minds were
directed to the contemplation of futurity; and children, who manifest
the more elevated feelings of the soul without alloy, were frequently
seen, while labouring under the plague, breathing out their spirit with
prayer and songs of thanksgiving[113].

An awful sense of contrition seized Christians of every communion; they
resolved to forsake their vices, to make restitution for past offences,
before they were summoned hence, to seek reconciliation with their
Maker, and to avert, by self-chastisement, the punishment due to their
former sins. Human nature would be exalted, could the countless noble
actions, which, in times of most imminent danger, were performed in
secret, be recorded for the instruction of future generations. They,
however, have no influence on the course of worldly events. They are
known only to silent eye-witnesses, and soon fall into oblivion. But
hypocrisy, illusion and bigotry, stalk abroad undaunted; they desecrate
what is noble, they pervert what is divine, to the unholy purposes
of selfishness; which hurries along every good feeling in the false
excitement of the age. Thus it was in the years of this plague. In the
14th century, the monastic system was still in its full vigour, the
power of the ecclesiastical orders and brotherhoods was revered by the
people, and the hierarchy was still formidable to the temporal power.
It was, therefore, in the natural constitution of society that bigoted
zeal, which in such times makes a show of public acts of penance,
should avail itself of the semblance of religion. But this took place
in such a manner, that unbridled, self-willed penitence, degenerated
into lukewarmness, renounced obedience to the hierarchy, and prepared
a fearful opposition to the church, paralysed as it was by antiquated
forms.

While all countries were filled with lamentations and woe, there first
arose in Hungary[114], and afterwards in Germany, the Brotherhood
of the Flagellants, called also the Brethren of the Cross, or
Cross-bearers, who took upon themselves the repentance of the people,
for the sins they had committed, and offered prayers and supplications
for the averting of this plague. This Order consisted chiefly of
persons of the lower class, who were either actuated by sincere
contrition, or, who joyfully availed themselves of this pretext for
idleness, and were hurried along with the tide of distracting frenzy.
But as these brotherhoods gained in repute, and were welcomed by the
people, with veneration and enthusiasm, many nobles and ecclesiastics
ranged themselves under their standard; and their bands were not
unfrequently augmented by children, honourable women and nuns; so
powerfully were minds of the most opposite temperaments enslaved
by this infatuation[115]. They marched through the cities, in well
organized processions, with leaders and singers; their heads covered as
far as the eyes; their look fixed on the ground, accompanied by every
token of the deepest contrition and mourning. They were robed in sombre
garments, with red crosses on the breast, back, and cap, and bore
triple scourges, tied in three or four knots, in which points of iron
were fixed[116]. Tapers and magnificent banners of velvet and cloth of
gold, were carried before them; wherever they made their appearance,
they were welcomed by the ringing of the bells; and the people flocked
from all quarters, to listen to their hymns and to witness their
penance, with devotion and tears.

In the year 1349, two hundred Flagellants first entered Strasburg,
where they were received with great joy, and hospitably lodged by the
citizens. Above a thousand joined the brotherhood, which now assumed
the appearance of a wandering tribe, and separated into two bodies, for
the purpose of journeying to the north and to the south. For more than
half a year, new parties arrived weekly; and, on each arrival, adults
and children left their families to accompany them; till, at length,
their sanctity was questioned, and the doors of houses and churches
were closed against them[117]. At Spires, two hundred boys, of twelve
years of age and under, constituted themselves into a Brotherhood of
the Cross, in imitation of the children, who, about a hundred years
before, had united, at the instigation of some fanatic monks, for the
purpose of recovering the Holy Sepulchre. All the inhabitants of this
town were carried away by the illusion; they conducted the strangers to
their houses with songs of thanksgiving, to regale them for the night.
The women embroidered banners for them, and all were anxious to augment
their pomp; and at every succeeding pilgrimage, their influence and
reputation increased[118].

It was not merely some individual parts of the country that fostered
them: all Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, Silesia, and Flanders,
did homage to the mania; and they at length became as formidable
to the secular, as they were to the ecclesiastical power. The
influence of this fanaticism was great and threatening; resembling
the excitement which called all the inhabitants of Europe into the
deserts of Syria and Palestine, about two hundred and fifty years
before. The appearance, in itself, was not novel. As far back as the
11th century, many believers, in Asia and Southern Europe, afflicted
themselves with the punishment of flagellation. Dominicus Loricatus,
a monk of St. Croce d’Avellano, is mentioned as the master and model
of this species of mortification of the flesh; which, according to
the primitive notions of the Asiatic Anchorites, was deemed eminently
Christian. The author of the solemn processions of the Flagellants, is
said to have been St. Anthony; for even in his time (1231), this kind
of penance was so much in vogue, that it is recorded as an eventful
circumstance in the history of the world. In 1260, the Flagellants
appeared in Italy as _Devoti_. “When the land was polluted by vices
and crimes[119], an unexampled spirit of remorse suddenly seized the
minds of the Italians. The fear of Christ fell upon all: noble and
ignoble, old and young, and even children of five years of age, marched
through the streets with no covering but a scarf round the waist. They
each carried a scourge of leathern thongs, which they applied to their
limbs, amid sighs and tears, with such violence, that the blood flowed
from the wounds. Not only during the day, but even by night, and in the
severest winter, they traversed the cities with burning torches and
banners, in thousands and tens of thousands, headed by their priests,
and prostrated themselves before the altars. They proceeded in the same
manner in the villages: and the woods and mountains resounded with the
voices of those whose cries were raised to God. The melancholy chaunt
of the penitent alone was heard. Enemies were reconciled; men and
women vied with each other in splendid works of charity, as if they
dreaded, that Divine Omnipotence would pronounce on them the doom of
annihilation.”

The pilgrimages of the Flagellants extended throughout all the
provinces of Southern Germany, as far as Saxony, Bohemia and
Poland, and even further; but at length, the priests resisted this
dangerous fanaticism, without being able to extirpate the illusion,
which was advantageous to the hierarchy, as long as it submitted to
its sway. Regnier, a hermit of Perugia, is recorded as a fanatic
preacher of penitence, with whom the extravagance originated[120].
In the year 1296, there was a great procession of the Flagellants in
Strasburg[121]; and in 1334, fourteen years before the great mortality,
the sermon of Venturinus, a Dominican friar, of Bergamo, induced
above 10,000 persons to undertake a new pilgrimage. They scourged
themselves in the churches, and were entertained in the market-places,
at the public expense. At Rome, Venturinus was derided, and banished
by the Pope to the mountains of Ricondona. He patiently endured
all—went to the Holy Land, and died at Smyrna, 1346[122]. Hence we
see that this fanaticism was a mania of the middle ages, which, in
the year 1349, on so fearful an occasion, and while still so fresh in
remembrance, needed no new founder; of whom, indeed, all the records
are silent. It probably arose in many places at the same time; for
the terror of death, which pervaded all nations and suddenly set such
powerful impulses in motion, might easily conjure up the fanaticism of
exaggerated and overpowering repentance.

The manner and proceedings of the Flagellants of the 13th and 14th
centuries, exactly resemble each other. But, if during the Black
Plague, simple credulity came to their aid, which seized, as a
consolation, the grossest delusion of religious enthusiasm, yet it is
evident that the leaders must have been intimately united, and have
exercised the power of a secret association. Besides, the rude band
was generally under the control of men of learning, some of whom at
least, certainly had other objects in view, independent of those which
ostensibly appeared. Whoever was desirous of joining the brotherhood,
was bound to remain in it thirty-four days, and to have four pence per
day at his own disposal, so that he might not be burthensome to any
one; if married, he was obliged to have the sanction of his wife, and
give the assurance that he was reconciled to all men. The Brothers
of the Cross, were not permitted to seek for free quarters, or even
to enter a house without having been invited; they were forbidden to
converse with females; and if they transgressed these rules, or acted
without discretion, they were obliged to confess to the Superior, who
sentenced them to several lashes of the scourge, by way of penance.
Ecclesiastics had not, as such, any pre-eminence among them; according
to their original law, which, however, was often transgressed, they
could not become Masters, or take part in the _Secret Councils_.
Penance was performed twice every day: in the morning and evening, they
went abroad in pairs, singing psalms, amid the ringing of the bells;
and when they arrived at the place of flagellation, they stripped the
upper part of their bodies and put off their shoes, keeping on only a
linen dress, reaching from the waist to the ancles. They then lay down
in a large circle, in different positions, according to the nature of
their crime: the adulterer with his face to the ground; the perjurer
on one side, holding up three of his fingers, &c., and were then
castigated, some more and some less, by the Master, who ordered them to
rise in the words of a prescribed form[123]. Upon this, they scourged
themselves, amid the singing of psalms and loud supplications for
the averting of the plague, with genuflexions, and other ceremonies,
of which contemporary writers give various accounts; and at the same
time constantly boasted of their penance, that the blood of their
wounds was mingled with that of the Saviour[124]. One of them, in
conclusion, stood up to read a letter, which it was pretended an angel
had brought from heaven, to St. Peter’s church, at Jerusalem, stating
that Christ, who was sore displeased at the sins of man, had granted,
at the intercession of the Holy Virgin and of the angels, that all who
should wander about for thirty-four days and scourge themselves, should
be partakers of the Divine grace[125]. This scene caused as great a
commotion among the believers as the finding of the holy spear once did
at Antioch; and if any among the clergy inquired who had sealed the
letter? he was boldly answered, the same who had sealed the Gospel!

All this had so powerful an effect, that the church was in considerable
danger; for the Flagellants gained more credit than the priests, from
whom they so entirely withdrew themselves, that they even absolved
each other. Besides, they everywhere took possession of the churches,
and their new songs, which went from mouth to mouth, operated strongly
on the minds of the people. Great enthusiasm and originally pious
feelings, are clearly distinguishable in these hymns, and especially in
the chief psalm of the Cross-bearers, which is still extant, and which
was sung all over Germany, in different dialects, and is probably of
a more ancient date[126]. Degeneracy, however, soon crept in; crimes
were everywhere committed; and there was no energetic man capable of
directing the individual excitement to purer objects, even had an
effectual resistance to the tottering church been at that early period
seasonable, and had it been possible to restrain the fanaticism.
The Flagellants sometimes undertook to make trial of their power of
working miracles; as in Strasburg, where they attempted, in their own
circle, to resuscitate a dead child: they however failed, and their
unskilfulness did them much harm, though they succeeded here and there
in maintaining some confidence in their holy calling, by pretending to
have the power of casting out evil spirits[127].

The Brotherhood of the Cross announced that the pilgrimage of the
Flagellants was to continue for a space of thirty-four years; and many
of the Masters had, doubtless, determined to form a lasting league
against the church; but they had gone too far. So early as the first
year of their establishment, the general indignation set bounds to
their intrigues; so that the strict measures adopted by the Emperor
Charles IV., and Pope Clement[128], who, throughout the whole of this
fearful period, manifested prudence and noble-mindedness, and conducted
himself in a manner every way worthy of his high station, were easily
put into execution[129].

The Sorbonne, at Paris, and the Emperor Charles, had already applied
to the Holy See, for assistance against these formidable and heretical
excesses, which had well nigh destroyed the influence of the clergy in
every place; when a hundred of the Brotherhood of the Cross arrived
at Avignon from Basle, and desired admission. The Pope, regardless
of the intercession of several cardinals, interdicted their public
penance, which he had not authorized; and, on pain of excommunication,
prohibited throughout Christendom the continuance of these
pilgrimages[130]. Philip VI., supported by the condemnatory judgment
of the Sorbonne, forbad their reception in France[131]. Manfred, King
of Sicily, at the same time threatened them with punishment by death:
and in the East, they were withstood by several bishops, among whom was
Janussius, of Gnesen[132], and Preczlaw, of Breslaw, who condemned to
death one of their Masters, formerly a deacon; and, in conformity with
the barbarity of the times, had him publicly burnt[133]. In Westphalia,
where so shortly before they had venerated the Brothers of the Cross,
they now persecuted them with relentless severity[134]; and in the
Mark, as well as in all the other countries of Germany, they pursued
them, as if they had been the authors of every misfortune[135].

The processions of the Brotherhood of the Cross undoubtedly promoted
the spreading of the plague; and it is evident, that the gloomy
fanaticism which gave rise to them, would infuse a new poison into the
already desponding minds of the people.

Still, however, all this was within the bounds of barbarous enthusiasm;
but horrible were the persecutions of the Jews, which were committed
in most countries, with even greater exasperation than in the 12th
century, during the first Crusades. In every destructive pestilence,
the common people at first attribute the mortality to poison. No
instruction avails; the supposed testimony of their eyesight, is to
them a proof, and they authoritatively demand the victims of their
rage. On whom then was it so likely to fall, as on the Jews, the
usurers and the strangers who lived at enmity with the Christians? They
were everywhere suspected of having poisoned the wells or infected the
air[136]. They alone were considered as having brought this fearful
mortality upon the Christians[137]. They were, in consequence, pursued
with merciless cruelty; and either indiscriminately given up to the
fury of the populace, or sentenced by sanguinary tribunals, which,
with all the forms of law, ordered them to be burnt alive. In times
like these, much is indeed said of guilt and innocence; but hatred and
revenge bear down all discrimination, and the smallest probability,
magnifies suspicion into certainty. These bloody scenes, which
disgraced Europe in the 14th century, are a counterpart to a similar
mania of the age, which was manifested in the persecutions of witches
and sorcerers; and, like these they prove, that enthusiasm, associated
with hatred, and leagued with the baser passions, may work more
powerfully upon whole nations, than religion and legal order; nay, that
it even knows how to profit by the authority of both, in order the more
surely to satiate with blood, the sword of long suppressed revenge.

The persecution of the Jews commenced in September and October,
1348[138], at Chillon, on the Lake of Geneva, where the first criminal
proceedings were instituted against them, after they had long before
been accused by the people of poisoning the wells; similar scenes
followed in Bern and Freyburg, in January, 1349. Under the influence of
excruciating suffering, the tortured Jews confessed themselves guilty
of the crime imputed to them; and it being affirmed that poison had in
fact been found in a well at Zoffingen, this was deemed a sufficient
proof to convince the world; and the persecution of the abhorred
culprits, thus appeared justifiable. Now, though we can take as little
exception at these proceedings, as at the multifarious confessions of
witches, because the interrogatories of the fanatical and sanguinary
tribunals, were so complicated, that by means of the rack, the required
answer must inevitably be obtained; and it is besides conformable
to human nature, that crimes which are in every body’s mouth, may,
in the end, be actually committed by some, either from wantonness,
revenge, or desperate exasperation: yet crimes and accusations are,
under circumstances like these, merely the offspring of a revengeful,
frenzied spirit in the people; and the accusers, according to the
fundamental principles of morality, which are the same in every age,
are the more guilty transgressors.

Already in the autumn of 1348, a dreadful panic, caused by this
supposed empoisonment, seized all nations; in Germany especially, the
springs and wells were built over, that nobody might drink of them, or
employ their contents for culinary purposes: and for a long time, the
inhabitants of numerous towns and villages, used only river and rain
water[139]. The city gates were also guarded with the greatest caution:
only confidential persons were admitted; and if medicine, or any other
article, which might be supposed to be poisonous, was found in the
possession of a stranger,—and it was natural that some should have
these things by them for their private use,—they were forced to swallow
a portion of it[140]. By this trying state of privation, distrust and
suspicion, the hatred against the supposed poisoners became greatly
increased, and often broke out in popular commotions, which only served
still further to infuriate the wildest passions. The noble and the
mean, fearlessly bound themselves by an oath, to extirpate the Jews
by fire and sword, and to snatch them from their protectors, of whom
the number was so small, that throughout all Germany, but few places
can be mentioned where these unfortunate people were not regarded as
outlaws and martyred and burnt[141]. Solemn summonses were issued from
Bern to the towns of Basle, Freyburg in the Breisgau, and Strasburg, to
pursue the Jews as poisoners. The Burgomasters and Senators, indeed,
opposed this requisition; but in Basle the populace obliged them to
bind themselves by an oath, to burn the Jews, and to forbid persons of
that community from entering their city, for the space of two hundred
years. Upon this, all the Jews in Basle, whose number could not have
been inconsiderable, were inclosed in a wooden building, constructed
for the purpose, and burnt together with it, upon the mere outcry of
the people, without sentence or trial, which indeed would have availed
them nothing. Soon after, the same thing took place at Freyburg. A
regular Diet was held at Bennefeld, in Alsace, where the bishops, lords
and barons, as also deputies of the counties and towns, consulted how
they should proceed with regard to the Jews; and when the deputies of
Strasburg —not indeed the bishop of this town, who proved himself a
violent fanatic—spoke in favour of the persecuted, as nothing criminal
was substantiated against them; a great outcry was raised, and it was
vehemently asked, why, if so, they had covered their wells and removed
their buckets? A sanguinary decree was resolved upon, of which the
populace, who obeyed the call of the nobles and superior clergy, became
but the too willing executioners[142]. Wherever the Jews were not
burnt, they were at least banished; and so being compelled to wander
about, they fell into the hands of the country people, who without
humanity, and regardless of all laws, persecuted them with fire and
sword. At Spires, the Jews, driven to despair, assembled in their own
habitations, which they set on fire, and thus consumed themselves
with their families. The few that remained were forced to submit to
baptism; while the dead bodies of the murdered, which lay about the
streets, were put into empty wine casks, and rolled into the Rhine,
lest they should infect the air. The mob was forbidden to enter the
ruins of the habitations that were burnt in the Jewish quarter; for the
senate itself caused search to be made for the treasure, which is said
to have been very considerable. At Strasburg, two thousand Jews were
burnt alive in their own burial ground, where a large scaffold had been
erected: a few who promised to embrace Christianity, were spared, and
their children taken from the pile. The youth and beauty of several
females also excited some commiseration; and they were snatched from
death against their will: many, however, who forcibly made their escape
from the flames, were murdered in the streets.

The senate ordered all pledges and bonds to be returned to the debtors,
and divided the money among the work-people[143]. Many, however,
refused to accept the base price of blood, and, indignant at the
scenes of blood-thirsty avarice, which made the infuriated multitude
forget[144] that the plague was raging around them, presented it to
monasteries, in conformity with the advice of their confessors. In all
the countries on the Rhine, these cruelties continued to be perpetrated
during the succeeding months; and after quiet was in some degree
restored, the people thought to render an acceptable service to God, by
taking the bricks of the destroyed dwellings, and the tombstones of the
Jews, to repair churches and to erect belfries[145].

In Mayence alone, 12,000 Jews are said to have been put to a cruel
death. The Flagellants entered that place in August; the Jews, on
this occasion, fell out with the Christians, and killed several; but
when they saw their inability to withstand the increasing superiority
of their enemies, and that nothing could save them from destruction,
they consumed themselves and their families, by setting fire to their
dwellings. Thus also, in other places, the entry of the Flagellants
gave rise to scenes of slaughter; and as thirst for blood was
everywhere combined with an unbridled spirit of proselytism, a fanatic
zeal arose among the Jews, to perish as martyrs to their ancient
religion. And how was it possible, that they could from the heart
embrace Christianity, when its precepts were never more outrageously
violated? At Eslingen, the whole Jewish community burned themselves
in their synagogue[146]; and mothers were often seen throwing their
children on the pile, to prevent their being baptized, and then
precipitating themselves into the flames[147]. In short, whatever
deeds, fanaticism, revenge, avarice and desperation, in fearful
combination, could instigate mankind to perform,—and where in such a
case is the limit?—were executed in the year 1349, throughout Germany,
Italy and France, with impunity, and in the eyes of all the world.
It seemed as if the plague gave rise to scandalous acts and frantic
tumults, not to mourning and grief: and the greater part of those who,
by their education and rank, were called upon to raise the voice of
reason, themselves led on the savage mob to murder and to plunder.
Almost all the Jews who saved their lives by baptism, were afterwards
burnt at different times; for they continued to be accused of poisoning
the water and the air. Christians also, whom philanthropy or gain had
induced to offer them protection, were put on the rack and executed
with them[148]. Many Jews who had embraced Christianity, repented of
their apostacy,—and, returning to their former faith, sealed it with
their death[149].

The humanity and prudence of Clement VI., must, on this occasion,
also be mentioned to his honour; but even the highest ecclesiastical
power was insufficient to restrain the unbridled fury of the people.
He not only protected the Jews at Avignon, as far as lay in his power,
but also issued two bulls, in which he declared them innocent; and
admonished all Christians, though without success, to cease from
such groundless persecutions[150]. The Emperor Charles IV. was also
favourable to them, and sought to avert their destruction, wherever
he could; but he dared not draw the sword of justice, and even found
himself obliged to yield to the selfishness of the Bohemian nobles,
who were unwilling to forego so favourable an opportunity of releasing
themselves from their Jewish creditors, under favour of an imperial
mandate[151]. Duke Albert of Austria burned and pillaged those of his
cities, which had persecuted the Jews,—a vain and inhuman proceeding,
which, moreover, is not exempt from the suspicion of covetousness; yet
he was unable, in his own fortress of Kyberg, to protect some hundreds
of Jews, who had been received there, from being barbarously burnt by
the inhabitants[152]. Several other princes and counts, among whom
was Ruprecht von der Pfalz, took the Jews under their protection on
the payment of large sums: in consequence of which they were called
“Jew-masters,” and were in danger of being attacked by the populace
and by their powerful neighbours[153]. These persecuted and ill-used
people, except indeed where humane individuals took compassion on them
at their own peril, or when they could command riches to purchase
protection, had no place of refuge left but the distant country
of Lithuania, where Boleslav V., Duke of Poland (1227–1279), had
before granted them liberty of conscience; and King Casimir the Great
(1333–1370), yielding to the entreaties of Esther, a favourite Jewess,
received them, and granted them further protection[154]: on which
account, that country is still inhabited by a great number of Jews,
who by their secluded habits, have, more than any people in Europe,
retained the manners of the middle ages.

But to return to the fearful accusations against the Jews; it was
reported in all Europe, that they were in connexion with secret
superiors in Toledo, to whose decrees they were subject, and from
whom they had received commands respecting the coining of base money,
poisoning, the murder of Christian children, &c.[155]; that they
received the poison by sea from remote parts, and also prepared it
themselves from spiders, owls and other venomous animals; but, in
order that their secret might not be discovered, that it was known
only to the Rabbis and rich men[156]. Apparently there were but few
who did not consider this extravagant accusation well founded; indeed,
in many writings of the 14th century, we find great acrimony with
regard to the suspected poison mixers, which plainly demonstrates the
prejudice existing against them. Unhappily, after the confessions of
the first victims in Switzerland, the rack extorted similar ones in
various places. Some even acknowledged having received poisonous powder
in bags, and injunctions from Toledo, by secret messengers. Bags of
this description were also often found in wells, though it was not
unfrequently discovered that the Christians themselves had thrown them
in; probably to give occasion to murder and pillage; similar instances
of which may be found in the persecutions of the witches[157].

This picture needs no additions. A lively image of the Black Plague,
and of the moral evil which followed in its train, will vividly
represent itself to him who is acquainted with nature and the
constitution of society. Almost the only credible accounts of the
manner of living, and of the ruin which occurred in private life,
during this pestilence, are from Italy; and these may enable us to form
a just estimate of the general state of families in Europe, taking into
consideration what is peculiar in the manners of each country.

“When the evil had become universal,” (speaking of Florence,) “the
hearts of all the inhabitants were closed to feelings of humanity.
They fled from the sick and all that belonged to them, hoping by these
means to save themselves. Others shut themselves up in their houses,
with their wives, their children and households, living on the most
costly food, but carefully avoiding all excess. None were allowed
access to them; no intelligence of death or sickness was permitted
to reach their ears; and they spent their time in singing and music,
and other pastimes. Others, on the contrary, considered eating and
drinking to excess, amusements of all descriptions, the indulgence of
every gratification, and an indifference to what was passing around
them, as the best medicine, and acted accordingly. They wandered day
and night, from one tavern to another, and feasted without moderation
or bounds. In this way they endeavoured to avoid all contact with the
sick, and abandoned their houses and property to chance, like men whose
death-knell had already tolled.

“Amid this general lamentation and woe, the influence and authority
of every law, human and divine, vanished. Most of those who were in
office, had been carried off by the plague, or lay sick, or had lost
so many members of their families, that they were unable to attend
to their duties; so that thenceforth every one acted as he thought
proper. Others, in their mode of living, chose a middle course.
They ate and drank what they pleased, and walked abroad, carrying
odoriferous flowers, herbs or spices, which they smelt to from time
to time, in order to invigorate the brain, and to avert the baneful
influence of the air, infected by the sick, and by the innumerable
corpses of those who had died of the plague. Others carried their
precaution still further, and thought the surest way to escape death
was by flight. They therefore left the city; women as well as men
abandoning their dwellings and their relations, and retiring into the
country. But of these also, many were carried off, most of them alone
and deserted by all the world, themselves having previously set the
example. Thus it was, that one citizen fled from another—a neighbour
from his neighbours—a relation from his relations; and in the end, so
completely had terror extinguished every kindlier feeling, that the
brother forsook the brother—the sister the sister—the wife her husband;
and at last, even the parent his own offspring, and abandoned them,
unvisited and unsoothed, to their fate. Those, therefore, that stood
in need of assistance fell a prey to greedy attendants; who for an
exorbitant recompense, merely handed the sick their food and medicine,
remained with them in their last moments, and then not unfrequently,
became themselves victims to their avarice and lived not to enjoy
their extorted gain. Propriety and decorum were extinguished among
the helpless sick. Females of rank seemed to forget their natural
bashfulness, and committed the care of their persons, indiscriminately,
to men and women of the lowest order. No longer were women, relatives
or friends, found in the house of mourning, to share the grief of
the survivors—no longer was the corpse accompanied to the grave by
neighbours and a numerous train of priests, carrying wax tapers and
singing psalms, nor was it borne along by other citizens of equal rank.
Many breathed their last without a friend to sooth their dying pillow;
and few indeed were they who departed amid the lamentations and tears
of their friends and kindred. Instead of sorrow and mourning, appeared
indifference, frivolity and mirth; this being considered, especially
by the females, as conducive to health. Seldom was the body followed
by even ten or twelve attendants; and instead of the usual bearers and
sextons, mercenaries of the lowest of the populace undertook the office
for the sake of gain; and accompanied by only a few priests, and often
without a single taper, it was borne to the very nearest church, and
lowered into the first grave that was not already too full to receive
it. Among the middling classes, and especially among the poor, the
misery was still greater. Poverty or negligence induced most of these
to remain in their dwellings, or in the immediate neighbourhood; and
thus they fell by thousands: and many ended their lives in the streets,
by day and by night. The stench of putrefying corpses was often the
first indication to their neighbours that more deaths had occurred. The
survivors, to preserve themselves from infection, generally had the
bodies taken out of the houses, and laid before the doors; where the
early morn found them in heaps, exposed to the affrighted gaze of the
passing stranger. It was no longer possible to have a bier for every
corpse,—three or four were generally laid together—husband and wife,
father and mother, with two or three children, were frequently borne
to the grave on the same bier; and it often happened that two priests
would accompany a coffin, bearing the cross before it, and be joined on
the way by several other funerals; so that instead of one, there were
five or six bodies for interment.”

Thus far Boccacio. On the conduct of the priests, another contemporary
observes[158]: “In large and small towns, they had withdrawn themselves
through fear, leaving the performance of ecclesiastical duties to the
few who were found courageous and faithful enough to undertake them.”
But we ought not on that account to throw more blame on them than on
others; for we find proofs of the same timidity and heartlessness in
every class. During the prevalence of the Black Plague, the charitable
orders conducted themselves admirably, and did as much good as can be
done by individual bodies, in times of great misery and destruction;
when compassion, courage, and the nobler feelings, are found but in the
few, while cowardice, selfishness and ill-will, with the baser passions
in their train, assert the supremacy. In place of virtue, which had
been driven from the earth, wickedness everywhere reared her rebellious
standard, and succeeding generations were consigned to the dominion of
her baleful tyranny.





                              PHYSICIANS.


If we now turn to the medical talent which encountered the “_Great
Mortality_,” the middle ages must stand excused, since even the
moderns are of opinion that the art of medicine is not able to cope
with the Oriental plague, and can afford deliverance from it only
under particularly favourable circumstances[159]. We must bear in mind
also, that human science and art appear particularly weak in great
pestilences, because they have to contend with the powers of nature, of
which they have no knowledge; and which, if they had been, or could be
comprehended in their collective effects, would remain uncontrollable
by them, principally on account of the disordered condition of human
society. Moreover, every new plague has its peculiarities, which are
the less easily discovered on first view, because, during its ravages,
fear and consternation humble the proud spirit.

The physicians of the 14th century, during the Black Death, did what
human intellect could do in the actual condition of the healing art;
and their knowledge of the disease was by no means despicable. They,
like the rest of mankind, have indulged in prejudices, and defended
them, perhaps, with too much obstinacy; some of these, however, were
founded on the mode of thinking of the age, and passed current in those
days, as established truths: others continue to exist to the present
hour.

Their successors in the 19th century, ought not therefore to vaunt
too highly the pre-eminence of their knowledge, for they too will be
subjected to the severe judgment of posterity—they too, will, with
reason, be accused of human weakness and want of foresight.

The medical faculty of Paris, the most celebrated of the 14th century,
were commissioned to deliver their opinion on the causes of the Black
Plague, and to furnish some appropriate regulations with regard to
living, during its prevalence. This document is sufficiently remarkable
to find a place here.

“We, the Members of the College of Physicians of Paris, have, after
mature consideration and consultation on the present mortality,
collected the advice of our old masters in the art, and intend to make
known the causes of this pestilence, more clearly than could be done
according to the rules and principles of astrology and natural science;
we, therefore, declare as follows:—

“It is known that in India, and the vicinity of the Great Sea, the
constellations which combated the rays of the sun, and the warmth of
the heavenly fire, exerted their power especially against that sea, and
struggled violently with its waters. (Hence, vapours often originate
which envelope the sun, and convert his light into darkness.) These
vapours alternately rose and fell for twenty-eight days; but at last,
sun and fire acted so powerfully upon the sea, that they attracted a
great portion of it to themselves, and the waters of the ocean arose
in the form of vapour; thereby the waters were, in some parts, so
corrupted, that the fish which they contained, died. These corrupted
waters, however, the heat of the sun could not consume, neither could
other wholesome water, hail or snow, and dew, originate therefrom. On
the contrary, this vapour spread itself through the air in many places
on the earth, and enveloped them in fog.

“Such was the case all over Arabia, in a part of India; in Crete; in
the plains and valleys of Macedonia; in Hungary, Albania and Sicily.
Should the same thing occur in Sardinia, not a man will be left alive;
and the like will continue, so long as the sun remains in the sign
of Leo, on all the islands and adjoining countries to which this
corrupted sea-wind extends, or has already extended from India. If the
inhabitants of those parts do not employ and adhere to the following,
or similar means and precepts, we announce to them inevitable
death—except the grace of Christ preserve their lives.

“We are of opinion, that the constellations, with the aid of Nature,
strive, by virtue of their divine might, to protect and heal the human
race; and to this end, in union with the rays of the sun, acting
through the power of fire, endeavour to break through the mist.
Accordingly, within the next ten days, and until the 17th of the
ensuing month of July, this mist will be converted into a stinking
deleterious rain, whereby the air will be much purified. Now, as soon
as this rain shall announce itself, by thunder or hail, every one of
you should protect himself from the air; and, as well before as after
the rain, kindle a large fire of vine-wood, green laurel, or other
green wood; wormwood and chamomile should also be burnt in great
quantity in the market-places, in other densely inhabited localities,
and in the houses. Until the earth is again completely dry, and for
three days afterwards, no one ought to go abroad in the fields. During
this time the diet should be simple, and people should be cautious
in avoiding exposure in the cool of the evening, at night, and in
the morning. Poultry and water-fowl, young pork, old beef, and fat
meat, in general, should not be eaten; but on the contrary, meat of
a proper age, of a warm and dry, but on no account of a heating and
exciting nature. Broth should be taken, seasoned with ground pepper,
ginger and cloves, especially by those who are accustomed to live
temperately, and are yet choice in their diet. Sleep in the day-time
is detrimental; it should be taken at night until sunrise, or somewhat
longer. At breakfast, one should drink little; supper should be taken
an hour before sunset, when more may be drunk than in the morning.
Clear light wine, mixed with a fifth or sixth part of water, should
be used as a beverage. Dried or fresh fruits, with wine, are not
injurious; but highly so without it. Beet-root and other vegetables,
whether eaten pickled or fresh, are hurtful; on the contrary, spicy
pot-herbs, as sage or rosemary, are wholesome. Cold, moist, watery
food is in general prejudicial. Going out at night, and even until
three o’clock in the morning, is dangerous, on account of the dew. Only
small river fish should be used. Too much exercise is hurtful. The body
should be kept warmer than usual, and thus protected from moisture
and cold. Rain-water must not be employed in cooking, and every one
should guard against exposure to wet weather. If it rain, a little fine
treacle should be taken after dinner. Fat people should not sit in the
sunshine. Good clear wine should be selected and drunk often, but in
small quantities, by day. Olive oil as an article of food, is fatal.
Equally injurious are fasting and excessive abstemiousness, anxiety
of mind, anger, and immoderate drinking. Young people, in autumn
especially, must abstain from all these things, if they do not wish to
run a risk of dying of dysentery. In order to keep the body properly
open, an enema, or some other simple means, should be employed, when
necessary. Bathing is injurious. Men must preserve chastity as they
value their lives. Every one should impress this on his recollection,
but especially those who reside on the coast, or upon an island into
which the noxious wind has penetrated.”[160]

On what occasion these strange precepts were delivered can no longer
be ascertained, even if it were an object to know it. It must be
acknowledged, however, that they do not redound to the credit either
of the faculty of Paris, or of the 14th century in general. This
famous faculty found themselves under the painful necessity of being
wise at command, and of firing a point blank shot of erudition at an
enemy who enveloped himself in a dark mist, of the nature of which
they had no conception. In concealing their ignorance by authoritative
assertions, they suffered themselves, therefore, to be misled; and
while endeavouring to appear to the world with eclat, only betrayed to
the intelligent their lamentable weakness. Now some might suppose, that
in the condition of the sciences of the 14th century, no intelligent
physicians existed; but this is altogether at variance with the laws of
human advancement, and is contradicted by history. The real knowledge
of an age is shewn only in the archives of its literature. Here alone
the genius of truth speaks audibly:—here alone men of talent deposit
the results of their experience and reflection, without vanity or a
selfish object. There is no ground for believing that, in the 14th
century, men of this kind were publicly questioned regarding their
views; and it is, therefore, the more necessary that impartial history
should take up their cause and do justice to their merits.

The first notice on this subject is due to a very celebrated teacher
in Perugia, Gentilis of Foligno, who, on the 18th of June, 1348,
fell a sacrifice to the plague, in the faithful discharge of his
duty[161]. Attached to Arabian doctrines, and to the universally
respected Galen, he, in common with all his contemporaries, believed
in a putrid corruption of the blood in the lungs and in the heart,
which was occasioned by the pestilential atmosphere, and was forthwith
communicated to the whole body. He thought, therefore, that every thing
depended upon a sufficient purification of the air, by means of large
blazing fires of odoriferous wood, in the vicinity of the healthy, as
well as of the sick, and also upon an appropriate manner of living;
so that the putridity might not overpower the diseased. In conformity
with notions derived from the ancients, he depended upon bleeding
and purging, at the commencement of the attack, for the purpose of
purification; ordered the healthy to wash themselves frequently with
vinegar or wine, to sprinkle their dwellings with vinegar, and to
smell often to camphor, or other volatile substances. Hereupon he
gave, after the Arabian fashion, detailed rules, with an abundance of
different medicines, of whose healing powers wonderful things were
believed. He laid little stress upon super-lunar influences, so far as
respected the malady itself; on which account, he did not enter into
the great controversies of the astrologers, but always kept in view,
as an object of medical attention, the corruption of the blood in the
lungs and heart. He believed in a progressive infection from country
to country, according to the notions of the present day; and the
contagious power of the disease, even in the vicinity of those affected
by plague, was, in his opinion, beyond all doubt[162]. On this point,
intelligent contemporaries were all agreed; and in truth, it required
no great genius to be convinced of so palpable a fact. Besides,
correct notions of contagion have descended from remote antiquity,
and were maintained unchanged in the 14th century[163]. So far back
as the age of Plato, a knowledge of the contagious power of malignant
inflammations of the eye, of which also no physician of the middle ages
entertained a doubt[164], was general among the people[165]; yet, in
modern times, surgeons have filled volumes with partial controversies
on this subject. The whole language of antiquity has adapted itself to
the notions of the people, respecting the contagion of pestilential
diseases; and their terms were, beyond comparison, more expressive than
those in use among the moderns[166].

Arrangements for the protection of the healthy against contagious
diseases, the necessity of which is shewn from these notions, were
regarded by the ancients as useful; and by many, whose circumstances
permitted it, were carried into effect in their houses. Even a total
separation of the sick from the healthy, that indispensable means of
protection against infection by contact, was proposed by physicians
of the 2nd century after Christ, in order to check the spreading of
leprosy. But it was decidedly opposed, because, as it was alleged,
the healing art ought not to be guilty of such harshness[167]. This
mildness of the ancients, in whose manner of thinking inhumanity was
so often and so undisguisedly conspicuous, might excite surprise, if
it were any thing more than apparent. The true ground of the neglect
of public protection against pestilential diseases, lay in the general
notion and constitution of human society,—it lay in the disregard of
human life, of which the great nations of antiquity have given proofs
in every page of their history. Let it not be supposed that they wanted
knowledge respecting the propagation of contagious diseases. On the
contrary, they were as well informed on this subject as the moderns;
but this was shewn where individual property, not where human life, on
the grand scale, was to be protected. Hence the ancients made a general
practice of arresting the progress of murrains among cattle, by a
separation of the diseased from the healthy. Their herds alone enjoyed
that protection which they held it impracticable to extend to human
society, because they had no wish to do so[168]. That the governments
in the 14th century, were not yet so far advanced, as to put into
practice general regulations for checking the plague, needs no especial
proof. Physicians could, therefore, only advise public purifications of
the air by means of large fires, as had often been practised in ancient
times; and they were obliged to leave it to individual families,
either to seek safety in flight, or to shut themselves up in their
dwellings[169], a method which answers in common plagues, but which
here afforded no complete security, because such was the fury of the
disease when it was at its height, that the atmosphere of whole cities
was penetrated by the infection.

Of the astral influence which was considered to have originated the
“_Great Mortality_,” physicians and learned men were as completely
convinced as of the fact of its reality. A grand conjunction of the
three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, in the sign of
Aquarius, which took place, according to Guy de Chauliac, on the 24th
of March, 1345, was generally received as its principal cause. In
fixing the day, this physician, who was deeply versed in astrology,
did not agree with others; whereupon there arose various disputations,
of weight in that age, but of none in ours; people, however, agreed
in this—that conjunctions of the planets infallibly prognosticated
great events; great revolutions of kingdoms, new prophets, destructive
plagues, and other occurrences which bring distress and horror on
mankind. No medical author of the 14th and 15th centuries omits an
opportunity of representing them as among the general prognostics
of great plagues; nor can we, for our parts, regard the astrology
of the middle ages, as a mere offspring of superstition. It has not
only, in common with all ideas which inspire and guide mankind, a
high historical importance, entirely independent of its error or
truth—for the influence of both is equally powerful—but there are also
contained in it, as in alchymy, grand thoughts of antiquity, of which
modern natural philosophy is so little ashamed that she claims them as
her property. Foremost among these, is the idea of the general life
which diffuses itself throughout the whole universe, expressed by the
greatest Greek sages, and transmitted to the middle ages, through the
new Platonic natural philosophy. To this impression of an universal
organism, the assumption of a reciprocal influence of terrestrial
bodies could not be foreign[170], nor did this cease to correspond with
a higher view of nature, until astrologers overstepped the limits of
human knowledge with frivolous and mystical calculations.

Guy de Chauliac, considers the influence of the conjunction, which was
held to be all-potent, as the chief general cause of the Black Plague;
and the diseased state of bodies, the corruption of the fluids,
debility, obstruction, and so forth, as the especial subordinate
causes[171]. By these, according to his opinion, the quality of
the air, and of the other elements, was so altered, that they set
poisonous fluids in motion towards the inward parts of the body, in
the same manner as the magnet attracts iron; whence there arose in the
commencement fever and the spitting of blood; afterwards, however, a
deposition in the form of glandular swellings and inflammatory boils.
Herein the notion of an epidemic constitution was set forth clearly,
and conformably to the spirit of the age. Of contagion, Guy de Chauliac
was completely convinced. He sought to protect himself against it by
the usual means[172]; and it was probably he who advised Pope Clement
VI. to shut himself up while the plague lasted. The preservation of
this pope’s life, however, was most beneficial to the city of Avignon,
for he loaded the poor with judicious acts of kindness, took care to
have proper attendants provided, and paid physicians himself to afford
assistance wherever human aid could avail—an advantage which, perhaps,
no other city enjoyed[173]. Nor was the treatment of plague-patients
in Avignon by any means objectionable; for, after the usual depletions
by bleeding and aperients, where circumstances required them, they
endeavoured to bring the buboes to suppuration; they made incisions
into the inflammatory boils, or burned them with a red-hot iron, a
practice which at all times proves salutary, and in the Black Plague
saved many lives. In this city, the Jews, who lived in a state of the
greatest filth, were most severely visited, as also the Spaniards, whom
Chalin accuses of great intemperance[174].

Still more distinct notions on the causes of the plague were stated
to his contemporaries in the 14th century, by Galeazzo di Santa
Sofia, a learned man, a native of Padua, who likewise treated
plague-patients at Vienna[175], though in what year is undetermined.
He distinguishes carefully _pestilence_ from _epidemy_ and _endemy_.
The common notion of the two first accords exactly with that of an
epidemic constitution, for both consist, according to him, in an
unknown change or corruption of the air; with this difference, that
_pestilence_ calls forth diseases of different kinds; _epidemy_, on
the contrary, always the same disease. As an example of an _epidemy_,
he adduces a cough (influenza) which was observed in all climates
at the same time, without perceptible cause; but he recognised the
approach of a _pestilence_, independently of unusual natural phenomena,
by the more frequent occurrence of various kinds of fever, to which
the modern physicians would assign a nervous and putrid character.
The _endemy_ originates, according to him, only in local telluric
changes—in deleterious influences which develop themselves in the
earth and in the water, without a corruption of the air. These notions
were variously jumbled together in his time, like every thing which
human understanding separates by too fine a line of limitation.
The estimation of cosmical influences, however, in the _epidemy_
and _pestilence_, is well worthy of commendation; and Santa Sofia,
in this respect, not only agrees with the most intelligent persons
of the 14th and 15th centuries, but he has also promulgated an
opinion which must, even now, serve as a foundation for our scarcely
commenced investigations into cosmical influences[176]. _Pestilence_
and _epidemy_, consist not in alterations of the four primary
qualities[177], but in a corruption of the air, powerful, though quite
immaterial, and not cognoscible by the senses:—(corruptio aëris non
substantialis, sed qualitativa) in a disproportion of the imponderables
in the atmosphere, as it would be expressed by the moderns[178]. The
causes of the _pestilence_ and _epidemy_ are, first of all, astral
influences, especially on occasion of planetary conjunctions; then
extensive putrefaction of animal and vegetable bodies, and terrestrial
corruptions (corruptio in terra); to which also, bad diet and want may
contribute. Santa Sofia considers the putrefaction of locusts, that had
perished in the sea, and were again thrown up, combined with astral and
terrestrial influences, as the cause of the pestilence in the eventful
year of the “_Great Mortality_.”

All the fevers which were called forth by the _pestilence_, are,
according to him, of the putrid kind; for they originate principally
from putridity of the heart’s blood, which inevitably follows the
inhalation of infected air. The Oriental Plague is, sometimes, but by
no means always, occasioned by _pestilence_ (?), which imparts to it
a character (qualitas occulta) hostile to human nature. It originates
frequently from other causes, among which, this physician was aware
that contagion was to be reckoned; and it deserves to be remarked, that
he held epidemic small-pox and measles to be infallible forerunners of
the plague, as do the physicians and people of the East[179], at the
present day.

In the exposition of his therapeutical views of the plague, a clearness
of intellect is again shewn by Santa Sofia, which reflects credit on
the age. It seemed to him to depend, 1st, on an evacuation of putrid
matters, by purgatives and bleeding: yet he did not sanction the
employment of these means indiscriminately, and without consideration;
least of all where the condition of the blood was healthy. He also
declared himself decidedly against bleeding ad deliquium (venæ sectio
eradicativa). 2d, Strengthening of the heart and prevention of
putrescence. 3d, Appropriate regimen. 4th, Improvement of the air.
5th, Appropriate treatment of tumid glands and inflammatory boils,
with emollient, or even stimulating poultices (mustard, lily-bulbs),
as well as with red-hot gold and iron. Lastly, 6th, Attention to
prominent symptoms. The stores of the Arabian pharmacy, which he
brought into action to meet all these indications, were indeed very
considerable; it is to be observed, however, that, for the most part,
gentle means were accumulated, which, in case of abuse, would do no
harm; for the character of the Arabian system of medicine, whose
principles were everywhere followed at this time, was mildness and
caution. On this account too, we cannot believe that a very prolix
treatise by Marsigli di Santa Sofia[180], a contemporary relative of
Galeazzo, on the prevention and treatment of plague, can have caused
much harm, although, perhaps, even in the 14th century, an agreeable
latitude and confident assertions respecting things which no mortal
has investigated, or which it is quite a matter of indifference to
distinguish, were considered as proofs of a valuable practical talent.

The agreement of contemporary and later writers, shews that the
published views of the most celebrated physicians of the 14th century,
were those generally adopted. Among these, Chalin de Vinario is
the most experienced. Though devoted to astrology, still more than
his distinguished contemporary, he acknowledges the great power of
terrestrial influences, and expresses himself very sensibly on the
indisputable doctrine of contagion, endeavouring thereby to apologize
for many surgeons and physicians of his time, who neglected their
duty[181]. He asserted boldly, and with truth, “_that all epidemic
diseases might become contagious[182], and all fevers epidemic_,” which
attentive observers of all subsequent ages have confirmed.

He delivered his sentiments on blood-letting with sagacity, as an
experienced physician; yet he was unable, as may be imagined, to
moderate the desire for bleeding shewn by the ignorant monks. He was
averse to draw blood from the veins of patients under fourteen years
of age; but counteracted inflammatory excitement in them by cupping;
and endeavoured to moderate the inflammation of the tumid glands by
leeches[183]. Most of those who were bled, died; he therefore reserved
this remedy for the plethoric; especially for the papal courtiers,
and the hypocritical priests, whom he saw gratifying their sensual
desires, and imitating Epicurus, whilst they pompously pretended to
follow Christ[184]. He recommended burning the boils with a red-hot
iron, only in the plague without fever, which occurred in single
cases[185]; and was always ready to correct those over-hasty surgeons,
who, with fire and violent remedies, did irremediable injury to their
patients[186]. Michael Savonarola, professor in Ferrara (1462),
reasoning on the susceptibility of the human frame to the influence of
pestilential infection, as the cause of such various modifications of
disease, expresses himself as a modern physician would on this point;
and an adoption of the principle of contagion was the foundation of
his definition of the plague[187]. No less worthy of observation are
the views of the celebrated Valescus of Taranta, who, during the final
visitation of the Black Death, in 1382, practised as a physician at
Montpellier, and handed down to posterity what has been repeated in
innumerable treatises on plague, which were written during the 15th and
16th centuries[188].

Of all these notions and views regarding the plague, whose development
we have represented, there are two especially, which are prominent in
historical importance:—1st, The opinion of learned physicians, that the
_pestilence_, or epidemic constitution, is the _parent of various kinds
of disease_; that the plague sometimes, indeed, but by no means always,
originates from it: that, to speak in the language of the moderns, _the
pestilence_ bears the same relation to contagion, that a predisposing
cause does to an occasional cause: and 2dly, the universal conviction
of the contagious power of that disease.

Contagion gradually attracted more notice: it was thought that in it,
the most powerful occasional cause might be avoided; the possibility of
protecting whole cities by separation, became gradually more evident;
and so horrifying was the recollection of the eventful year of the
“_Great Mortality_,” that before the close of the 14th century, ere
the ill effects of the Black Plague had ceased, nations endeavoured to
guard against the return of this enemy, by an earnest and effectual
defence.

The first regulation which was issued for this purpose, originated
with Viscount Bernabo, and is dated the 17th Jan. 1374. “Every
plague-patient was to be taken out of the city into the fields, there
to die or to recover. Those who attended upon a plague-patient, were
to remain apart for ten days, before they again associated with
any body. The priests were to examine the diseased, and point out
to special commissioners the persons infected; under punishment of
the confiscation of their goods, and of being burned alive. Whoever
imported the plague, the state condemned his goods to confiscation.
Finally, none except those who were appointed for that purpose, were to
attend plague-patients, under penalty of death and confiscation[189].”

These orders, in correspondence with the spirit of the 14th century,
are sufficiently decided to indicate a recollection of the good effects
of confinement, and of keeping at a distance those suspected of having
plague. It was said that Milan itself, by a rigorous barricado of three
houses in which the plague had broken out, maintained itself free from
the “_Great Mortality_,” for a considerable time[190]; and examples
of the preservation of individual families, by means of a strict
separation, were certainly very frequent. That these orders must have
caused universal affliction from their uncommon severity, as we know
to have been especially the case in the city of Reggio, may be easily
conceived; but Bernabo did not suffer himself to be deterred from his
purpose by fear—on the contrary, when the plague returned in the year
1383, he forbad the admission of people from infected places into his
territories, on pain of death[191]. We have now, it is true, no account
how far he succeeded; yet it is to be supposed that he arrested the
disease, for it had long lost the property of the Black Death, to
spread abroad in the air the contagious matter which proceeded from the
lungs, charged with putridity, and to taint the atmosphere of whole
cities by the vast numbers of the sick. Now that it had resumed its
milder form, so that it infected only by contact, it admitted being
confined within individual dwellings, as easily as in modern times.

Bernabo’s example was imitated; nor was there any century more
appropriate for recommending to governments strong regulations against
the plague, than the 14th; for when it broke out in Italy, in the year
1399, and still demanded new victims, it was for the 16th time; without
reckoning frequent visitations of measles and small-pox. In this same
year, Viscount John, in milder terms than his predecessor, ordered that
no stranger should be admitted from infected places, and that the city
gates should be strictly guarded. Infected houses were to be ventilated
for at least eight or ten days, and purified from noxious vapours
by fires, and by fumigations with balsamic and aromatic substances.
Straw, rags, and the like, were to be burned; and the bedsteads which
had been used, set out for four days in the rain or the sunshine, so
that, by means of the one or the other, the morbific vapour might be
destroyed. No one was to venture to make use of clothes or beds out of
infected dwellings, unless they had been previously washed and dried
either at the fire or in the sun. People were, likewise, to avoid,
as long as possible, occupying houses which had been frequented by
plague-patients[192].

We cannot precisely perceive in these an advance towards general
regulations; and perhaps people were convinced of the insurmountable
impediments which opposed the separation of open inland countries,
where bodies of people connected together could not be brought, even
by the most obdurate severity, to renounce the habit of a profitable
intercourse.

Doubtless it is nature which has done the most to banish the Oriental
plague from western Europe, where the increasing cultivation of the
earth, and the advancing order in civilized society, have prevented it
from remaining domesticated; which it most probably was in the more
ancient times.

In the 15th century, during which it broke out seventeen times in
different places in Europe[193], it was of the more consequence to
oppose a barrier to its entrance from Asia, Africa, and Greece (which
had become Turkish); for it would have been difficult for it to
maintain itself indigenously any longer. Among the southern commercial
states, however, which were called on to make the greatest exertions to
this end, it was principally Venice, formerly so severely attacked by
the Black Plague, that put the necessary restraint upon the perilous
profits of the merchant. Until towards the end of the 15th century, the
very considerable intercourse with the East was free and unimpeded.
Ships of commercial cities had often brought over the plague: nay, the
former irruption of the “_Great Mortality_” itself had been occasioned
by navigators. For, as in the latter end of Autumn, 1347, four ships
full of plague-patients returned from the Levant to Genoa, the disease
spread itself there with astonishing rapidity. On this account, in the
following year, the Genoese forbad the entrance of suspected ships into
their port. These sailed to Pisa and other cities on the coast, where
already nature had made such mighty preparations for the reception of
the Black Plague, and what we have already described took place in
consequence[194].

In the year 1485, when, among the cities of northern Italy, Milan
especially felt the scourge of the plague, a special council of
health, consisting of three nobles, was established at Venice, who
probably tried every thing in their power to prevent the entrance of
this disease, and gradually called into activity all those regulations
which have served in later times as a pattern for the other southern
states of Europe. Their endeavours were, however, not crowned with
complete success; on which account their powers were increased, in the
year 1504, by granting them the right of life and death over those who
violated the regulations[195]. Bills of health were probably first
introduced in the year 1527, during a fatal plague[196] which visited
Italy for five years (1525–30), and called forth redoubled caution.

The first lazarettos were established upon islands at some distance
from the city, seemingly as early as the year 1485. Here all strangers
coming from places where the existence of plague was suspected were
detained. If it appeared in the city itself, the sick were despatched
with their families to what was called the Old Lazaretto, were there
furnished with provisions and medicines, and, when they were cured,
were detained, together with all those who had had intercourse with
them, still forty days longer in the New Lazaretto, situated on another
island. All these regulations were every year improved, and their
needful rigour was increased, so that from the year 1585 onwards, no
appeal was allowed from the sentence of the Council of Health; and
the other commercial nations gradually came to the support of the
Venetians, by adopting corresponding regulations[197]. Bills of health,
however, were not general until the year 1665[198].

The appointment of a forty days’ detention, whence quarantines derive
their name, was not dictated by caprice, but probably had a medical
origin, which is derivable in part from the doctrine of critical
days; for the fortieth day, according to the most ancient notions,
has been always regarded as the last of ardent diseases, and the
limit of separation between these and those which are chronic. It was
the custom to subject lying-in women for forty days to a more exact
superintendence. There was a good deal also said in medical works of
forty day epochs in the formation of the fœtus, not to mention that
the alchymists expected more durable revolutions in forty days, which
period they called the philosophical month.

This period being generally held to prevail in natural processes, it
appeared reasonable to assume, and legally to establish it, as that
required for the development of latent principles of contagion, since
public regulations cannot dispense with decisions of this kind, even
though they should not be wholly justified by the nature of the case.
Great stress has likewise been laid on theological and legal grounds,
which were certainly of greater weight in the fifteenth century than in
more modern times[199].

On this matter, however, we cannot decide, since our only object here
is to point out the origin of a political means of protection against a
disease, which has been the greatest impediment to civilization within
the memory of man; a means, that, like Jenner’s vaccine, after the
small-pox had ravaged Europe for twelve hundred years, has diminished
the check which mortality puts on the progress of civilization, and
thus given to the life and manners of the nations of this part of the
world a new direction, the result of which we cannot foretell.
